The paper was titled ” Press Freedom in the New Social Media Age: Implications and the Law”. He said that the concept of press freedom was well entrenched in the laws of Nigeria. The silk said that the Nigerian Constitution imposed a duty on the media to hold government accountable to the people. He said that it also made provision for the freedom and right of the press to carry out the onerous task in aid of nation building. According to Adegboruwa, the press plays a pivotal role in every society, as it represents the conscience and values of a people. More importantly, he said, it is a veritable link of information exchange between the people and their government.

In his speech at the event, Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), assured of government’s resolve to ensure  press freedom thrives. The commissioner, who was represented by Dr Jide Martins, said that the state must act in a robust manner to ensure that press freedom was not abused, but used to advance constructive criticism. “It is pivotal that all citizens exercise and enjoy their right to freedom of expression, press freedom and association within the parameters of the law and other citizens’ rights are not breached. “Some of the advantages of social media are also some of its bane. “The fact that people can assume a false identity and disseminate information that can potentially cause offence, harm and breach of national security is of great concern”, he said. The Chairman of Nigeria Bar Association Lagos Island Branch, Mr Yemi Akangbe, said that one of the implications of the topic, “is that everyone is now a journalist even without formal training”. He said that the social media had opened the floodgate to fake news, which, however, should be checked. “There should be cyber monitoring team, to monitor what goes out. “The government should not be the only agency regulating information that goes out, the press can also do it themselves,” Akangbe said. Earlier, the NAJUC’s Chairman, Mr Peter Fowoyo, in his opening remarks, said the press must be free of all encumbrances in order to discharge its duty effectively to members of the public.
