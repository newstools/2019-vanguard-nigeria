Justice Yetunde Adesanya has ordered the Lagos state house of Assembly to maintain the status quo in the ongoing investigation of former Lagos state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode. Justice Adesanya gave the order on Wednesday while ruling on an exparte motion filed by Ambode through his counsel, Tayo Oyetibo SAN. The court had on Tuesday ordered Oyetibo to put the respondents on notice before hearing the exparte application. This is contrary to earlier reports that the court-ordered respondents to appear in court Wednesday. The respondents are the speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, House Clerk, Mr A.A Sanni; Chairman of the Ad hoc Committee set up by the House to probe the procurement, Fatai Mojeed and members of the Committee. They are Gbolahan Yishawu, A.A Yusuff, Yinka Ogundimu, Mojisola Lasbat Meranda, M.L Makinde, Kehinde Joseph, T.A Adewale, and O.S Afinni.
