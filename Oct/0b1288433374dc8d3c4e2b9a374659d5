Again, we [Ecobank and other stakeholders] must salute the efforts of the CBN for bringing together key stakeholders on a continuous basis to evaluate different aspects of cybersecurity and to further inoculate the system.” Speaking earlier, the Chairman NeFF, Mr Sam Okejere called for the review of existing, enactment of new laws in a bid to mitigate fraud risks in the payment system in the country. Okojere noted the imperativeness due to the re-introduction of cashless Policy that will increase electronic transactions and electronic fraud. It is necessary to review and strengthen the existing rules and enact new regulations to mitigate fraud risks in the payment system. As Evidenced by the NIBSS second quarter fraud report of 2019, attempted fraud volume decreased by 47.28 per cent in Q1 figures, while Web, ATM, and Mobile remain the usual suspects to be used by fraudsters” “Because of the cashless Policy re-introduction and following the trend of increase in usage of electronic transactions that occurred in 2012 against 2018, which has seen growth, there is a likelihood of continued increase in electronic transactions and corresponding potential upsurge in electronic fraud in spite of collective and concerted efforts to check fraud in the country” The Chairman said.
