The group said the call became necessary following revelations by the House of Representatives Committee on abandoned projects awarded by NDDC and expressed disappointment that  N67 billion was disbursed for contracts that were abandoned. According to NFPI, the abandoned projects have negatively impacted the development of critical infrastructure that would have bettered the life of the people of the Niger Delta region,thereby partially defeating the purpose for the creation of the Commission. NFPI urged the incoming management of the new board of NDDC to ensure that all the contractors involved in the abandoned projects move to site to complete the projects.

The group also advised Olorogun Okumagba and his new board to ensure that the Commission embarks on meaningful projects that will impact positively on the people of the region. According to Akpoyibo, “Olorogun Okumagba should ignore all voices of distraction, be focussed and carry out the mandate he has been given to justify the confidence reposed on him by President Muhammadu Buhari and the goodwill he enjoys from the people of the Niger Delta region.” Vanguard The Nigeria Female President Initiative, NFPI, a pro-democracy group, has countered the position of South-South governors on Federal Government nominees for appointment into various positions on the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.
