The suspect, Isiaka Ayobami, according to residents of Ayo Ijaiye street, had been suffering from mental disorder for long. It was gathered that the unsuspecting baby girl identified as Nana Aishat Isiaka, was with her mother, when the Ayobami, who lives almost adjacent the baby’s parents, suddenly seized her from the mother. Attempt by the mother to rescue her daughter from the suspect failed as he was alleged to have smashed her head on the floor. A resident, Muyideen Kashani, explained that “ I live down the street but came to visit a family friend opposite number 7, where the incident happened. We were seated outside when all of a sudden we heard an uproar. Before we could fathom what was happening, we saw the baby on the ground, jerking, before she went motionless”. Another resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, “ the suspect is the son of the owner of number 2 Ayo Ijaiye street. He has been having mental disorder. Anytime he goes violent, he would attack anyone he sees. “ There was no scuffle between the mother of the baby and Ayobami. The attack was so fast that the mother could not do anything to save her daughter”. An angry mob was said to have attacked the suspect and would have almost lynched him but for the swift arrival of a team of policemen who whisked him to the station.
