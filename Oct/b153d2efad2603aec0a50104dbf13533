The misdeeds of the randy father came to the open when his daughter confided in her school teacher during a class lesson on sex education. The suspect, a Sierra Leonean citizen was immediately picked up on the order of the chairperson of Federation of Women Lawyer FIDA, Mrs Seyi Ojo who was contacted by the school management. Mrs Ojo who described that act as despicable and intolerable, handed him over to the police for further investigation and prosecution. In an interview, the suspect Noel Davis who claimed to be a staff of Ekiti State University Ado Ekiti, said he did the act out of foolishness and pleaded for forgiveness. He said his wife had sometimes got to know about the act but it was settled amicably among the family.
