This assumption is confirmed by the number of startups emerging yearly from these areas and the amount attracted from tech investors. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1276340" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=428%2C241&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya tech startup CEOs, employees earnings revealed" width="428" height="241" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nigeria-Tech-Start-Ups.jpg?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> But a recent survey conducted by Timon Capital and Briter Bridges has revealed that tech startups in South Africa on average pay their CEOs and other employees more than any other African countries. The survey analysed 48 startups in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana. Start-up tech employees (CEOs inclusive) in South Africa earn as much as three times of their Nigerian counterparts according to the survey. The situation is worse in Ghana where when compared could sum up to about four times on average. The difference between payment in Kenya and South Africa is not much when compared to others. On average, CEOs in Ghana earn $15,769; Nigeria $21, 818; Kenya $64, 500; and South Africa $65, 714. The meagre payment of technology experts in Nigeria may be attributed to the brain drain and loss of interest which could significantly lead to subpar performance and reduced overall productivity.
