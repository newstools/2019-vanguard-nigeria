The convict was accused of  having unlawful sexual intercourse with the 2-year-old pupil. In her judgment, Justice Nwaka held that the prosecution has proven its case of defilement against the defendant beyond reasonable doubt, contrary to Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2011. The judge said, “The basic elements to consider in this case is that the accused had sex with the child; that there was penetration; that the evidence of the child must be corroborated. “The victim, in her evidence before the court, she said that Mr Adenakan put his mouth and his hand in her wee-wee (vagina). She also said that the supervisor put his mouth in the vagina of her bestfriend, Jenita. “The little girl said that Adenekan covered her mouth when she attempted to shout. And that he (defendant) defiled her twice inside the school premise; at his office and at the hallway”.
