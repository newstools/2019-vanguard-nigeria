The ‘sex for grade’ undercover journalist presented herself as being a 17-year-old secondary school graduate. 17-year-old is below the legal age of consent both in Lagos State and in the country. This means having a sexual relationship with a person of such age is classified as “child abuse” or better “child sexual abuse”. The lecturer invited her to his office for a number of tutorials. As a safety measure, the decoy has a panic button with her that alerts her colleagues in case of any danger. Reacting to the video, concerned Nigerians, including Atiku Abubakar. have taken to their social media platforms to strongly condemn the act of sexual harassment, while some shared their encounters with lecturers in different Nigerian universities.
