Commenting on the results, Urum Kalu Eke, Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings, attributed the performance to diversified revenue streams across the board. “Our performance in the third quarter reflects the growth trajectory over the first nine months of the year, with significant strides made in transforming the Group’s asset quality and diversifying our revenue streams across the board. “During the third quarter, our NPL declined further to 12.6 per cent as we approach the end of the curve in the resolution of our legacy portfolio. “We are confident of further reducing this to under 10% by the end of the current financial year,” Eke stated. He added that the management continued to focus on enhancing the risk framework processes of the bank, enabling an improvement in the quality of its loan book. “Concurrently, we have also continued our drive towards ensuing long-term operational efficiency, resulting in a one-off cost increase pushing our Cost Income Ratio for the first nine months. “In terms of our revenue generation, we have delivered further increases in our non-interest income, on the back of growth in electronic banking fees as well as improvements in transaction-led income. “Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making on numerous fronts and remain committed to not only enhancing shareholder value but also adhering to the long-standing principles of this great financial institution,” Eke said. vanguard FBN Holdings has recorded an impressive result for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2017 as its profit increased to N16.07 billion representing 141.29 per cent.
