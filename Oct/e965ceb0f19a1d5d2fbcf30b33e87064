Osigwe said that the company was constrained to make a statement following reports falsely credited to its chairman, Chief Innocent Chukwuma. He described the report as intended to sow a seed of discord between the company and the federal government, saying, “this plot has already failed” “We would have ignored the statement and the publication in its entirety, knowing that they are the handiwork of mischief makers, but being silent may be misconstrued as acceptance. “We are urging the public to disregard such report, we want to set the record straight, there is no such order from the federal government,” he said.

Osigwe, who noted that IVM was a major beneficiary of the automobile park initiative, advised the public to disregard the report. “Let us remember that Innoson Group’s chairman has recently announced that the company enjoys huge patronage and support from the Buhari-led administration. “As a company, we are patronized by government agencies such as the Nigerian Military, Police, Federal Road Safety Commission, Fire Service and Immigration. “We are in partnership with the Nigerian Air Force for development and promotion of joint activities and associated Aerospace Ground Equipment,” he said.
