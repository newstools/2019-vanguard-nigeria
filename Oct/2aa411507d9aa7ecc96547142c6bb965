Nigeria impressed with the ball but a late partnership between Tariq Hamza and Nitish Kumar helped boost Canada’s total to 158, and that was always a tall order for Nigeria. Nigeria’s batsmen did not stand a chance after being reduced to 2/2, and in spite of a few valiant partnerships, Canada was just too good for them. In spite of that, Nigeria will take the positives of the game as they prepare to face Oman on Wednesday.
