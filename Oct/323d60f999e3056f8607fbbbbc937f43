Disclosure of the partnership comes after long-time CEO Bill McDermott stepped down to make way for Morgan – the first woman to become CEO of a company in Germany’s blue-chip DAX index – alongside fellow Co-CEO Christian Klein. The deal – which helped SAP double new cloud bookings in the third quarter – addresses a complaint from many customers that it is too hard to shift from SAP’s traditional on-premise model to remotely hosted services. The partnership deepens SAP’s already close relationship with Microsoft and its Azure cloud division, although the Walldorf-based company also works with Google and Amazon Web Services in the cloud. De-emphasizing its own-brand cloud offering is turning out to be one factor supporting a pickup in SAP’s cloud gross margins. These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69% in the third quarter – compared with a 2023 target of 75%. In the third quarter, SAP reported a 10% increase in revenue and a 15% rise in operating profit, after adjusting one-off items and currencies, helping it to achieve an expansion of 1.7% in its operating margins. The company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023. SAP is due to update investors on strategy at a capital markets’ day in New York on Nov. 12.
