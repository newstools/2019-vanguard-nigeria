Innovation and society “Over the last decades, innovation has become a significant way to combat critical social risks and threats. In general, the result of innovation should always be improvement. Innovation leads to economic growth, better living standards among others,” he noted. Lasisi, who is also the President, Nigeria Academy of Engineering, said some researchers were unable to secure funding from international bodies because of the poor proposals they wrote. In his speech, the Rector of Yabatech, Engr. Obafemi Omokungbe, represented by the Deputy Rector, Academics, Engr. Kehinde Osifila, said the theme was timely as it was in tandem with the college’s responsibility to train mid-level manpower for the country. “Education and research are keys to the growth of the nation. Our management is committed to improving the methods of learning and teaching in this great institution and we recently appointed more qualified staff to boost our workforce,”he said. He assured of the Management’s support for research and innovation to set the institution on higher pedestal. The Chairman of the event, Mr George Majekodunmi Okufi warned lecturers against turning campuses to sex shops.
