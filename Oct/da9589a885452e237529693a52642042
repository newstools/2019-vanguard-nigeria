The major highlight of the night was two-set music performances on either half of the event by host artiste, Eben. The singer with a full complement of his beautifully dressed band dished out favourite songs from his repertoire taking the audience on a journey through his music. The night was enlivened with powerful live performances by two US-based musicians, veteran, Bob Fitts and Phil Thompson who blessed the audience with riveting performances. Popular Nigerian artistes such as Nathaniel Bassey, Mercy Chinwo, Sammie Okposo, Tim Godfrey, Joe Praise among others led the crowd in worship. According to Eben, the event will continue yearly and will be taken around the world with the hope of impacting lives through a culture of praise and worship of God Almighty. The mammoth crowd at this year's edition of The Experience music concert was overwhelming.  The noise emanating from conversations, whistle and trumpets by the crowd was most deafening at least not until the musicians took their turns on the stage.
