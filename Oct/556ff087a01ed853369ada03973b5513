The buses had reportedly suffered head-on collision at the bus-stop at about 1pm of Sunday leading to 20 of the passengers to suffer varying degrees of injuries. However, those who suffered minor injuries were treated on the spot while the remaining were taken to the nearest hospital for medical attention. He said the tragedy was recorded when one of the drivers who was driving on a fast speed lost control and suffered head-on collision with another bus. The LASEMA boss insists that the cause of the incident will be investigated and the erring driver punished if found culpable.  He said, “Investigations from the scene of the incident revealed that the diver was driving at an uncontrollable speed and we need to establish whether he was on drug or drunk and we have asked his boss to produce him for investigations,” he said.
