He said that the allocation had taken care of the interest of landlord communities. “The 2019/20 allocation has taken care of the landlord communities and with a spread covering various interest groups in the state. “This year’s allocation is carefully undertaken to ensure that the farmers adequately contribute to the regeneration and rehabilitation of the estates,’’ Ofuka said.
