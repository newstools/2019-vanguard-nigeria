The customs boss said that the seized bags of rice were either expired or about to expire. “The service has raised alarm and drew the attention of the general public to the fact that most of the imported bags of rice are expired. “The service had also in the past highlighted the rangers of the use of tramadol and had seized and kick-started the destruction of over N14 billion worth of tramadol recently. “It is unfortunate that those who imported these dangerous items do not wish us well. Imagine if they had succeeded in getting the expired rice in, re-bag and change the expiration date for Nigerians to consume. “The grave consequences of consuming these rice and the dreaded tramadol can only be imagined than experienced. “For the avoidance of doubt, let me restate the resolve of NCS and sister agencies to secure our land borders from such dangerous items.
