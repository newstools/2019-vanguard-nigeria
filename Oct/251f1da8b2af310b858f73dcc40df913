He said that traffic offence taken seriously in FCT included making calls while driving, driving on one way and carrying overload. Gwora appreciated the NGO for the #StopAtRed# campaign to help in enlightening Nigerians to always be disciplined and do what is right at all times. “I have good news for those who break traffic light especially when you get into the FCT if you are arrested for beating traffic light, first of all, you will be issued a ticket, secondly your vehicle will be impounded. “Thirdly, having paid your fine, you must go to the hospital for a psychological, emotional evaluation. If we don’t see that test results, your vehicle will remain with us. “So I want to tell Nigerians, especially those who are resident in the FCT, apart from breaking traffic light, don’t use the phone while driving, don’t take one way and also don’t carry overload, these offences are critical,” He said. Mr Dominic Obozuwa, Director, Fundacion Exito Ltd, (FundELG Africa), said the NGO was founded on September 2013 and the vision was to build a national ideology for the next generation. He said that the #StopAtRed# campaign was organised to mark the United Nations Day, stating that the sustainable development goal was relevant to the organisation. “The #StopAtRed Rally is a segment of#TheGreenCampaign, a strategic National Re-Birth Project created by FundELG Africa to promote adherence to traffic rules, making the roads safe, keeping the environment tidy by road users especially drivers; thus making our cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. “The inaugural #StopAtRed Campaign Rally will hold on Oct. 24 on the United Nations Day because the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development is relevant to FundELG Africa. “The essence of traffic rules is to protect all road users in Nigeria and strict adherence with these laid down rules will curb road accidents and incidences.” He said that the campaign was focused on promoting safety and national security. “The three-pronged objective of the #StopAtRed Rally is to promote road safety awareness, adherence to traffic rules, especially the traffic lights, zebra crossing, driving against traffic, creating multiple illegal lanes, to mention a few; symbolised by the hashtag, #StopAtRed. “Promote national security, peace and unity; symbolised by our convergence at, take-off from and return to the Unity Fountain, Abuja.” News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the UN Day is a commemoration of the entering into force of the UN Charter on October 24, 1945, to ensure international peace, security and co-operation among member nations.
