According to him, picking off the ultimate Victor, which gave him immunity from eviction, was his best period while on the show. Frodd added that he would say a prayer of gratitude to God on returning home after the show. “My fondest memory was the day I picked the ultimate victor, this was luck and grace. The day I picked up that badge was the best day ever. “When I get home there are a lot of things I will do, and when I step into my home, based on culture I will go into my room and say a prayer of gratitude to God. “I will definitely miss the Big Brother House because it is like a family house and please do not extend our time in case you are thinking of extending it. “Biggie thank you for teaching life lessons,  I know I am very stubborn but you kept me on track. Thank you for feeding me, it is not easy to feed me for three months.” “The experience in BBnaija, starting from the task had helped me realise my potentials and the experience gathered is the highest point of my life. “It is amazing that I am still standing on the last day. The experience has been round at that is what has brought me this far. “And for the mistake, I have made when I get home. I will look through and make my restitution,” he said.
