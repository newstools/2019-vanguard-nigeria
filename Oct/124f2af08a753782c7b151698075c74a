Banky W and his friend, Tunde Demuren, founded EME as a record label in 2002. In February 2018, Banky announced that EME had become a talent management company focused on creative marketing, advertising, PR and brand events.   #ManlikeMike – @aireyys is unquestionably one of the most focused housemates EVER in the history of #bigbrothernaija. Even BEFORE he got on the show, he was an ambitious and accomplished athlete and Businessman – with his stellar line of Beard Oil, Caps and @aireyyscigars (first black owned cigar company in the UK). Proud of the classy way he carried himself during the show, and excited to be partnering with him and his incredible wife @itspsd on their vision and plans going forward. Glad to announce that Mike has signed to @theofficialeme_’s management division. Welcome Mike and Perry to the family!!! Thank you for trusting us.
