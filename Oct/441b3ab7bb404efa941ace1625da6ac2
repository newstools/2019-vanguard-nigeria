Asabe also told the court that her husband, Ali Tada, has failed in his duty as a husband. ”I have been married to Ali for eight years and we have two children. My husband is a very violent and disrespectful man. ”He threatens my family members. He also beats, calls me names. He is also a wicked man. Asabe pleaded with the court to confirm the dissolution of the marriage and to also compel the respondent to pay her N237,000 he was owing to her. The respondent, however, denied all the allegations.
