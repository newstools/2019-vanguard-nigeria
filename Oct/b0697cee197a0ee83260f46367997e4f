Am SYLVESTER and am in my late 40’s. From school, I was a physically active person, with no peculiar health issues. I thought I was healthy but had no idea that I had this condition.” High blood pressure” I have never been tested of such disease. I only found out that I was hypertensive when I got a job that required me to undergo a full medical examination every year. Even though most times I feel sweaty, weak and headaches but I just don’t pay attention to those symptoms, I assume them to be result of Lagos stress. After I underwent the general test, it was confirmed that I was hypertensive. It was so bad because I was at stage 2 140/90MmHg. “It was difficult at first to accept that I had this condition and my first impression was that it was something over which I had no control. I was also initially resistant to the idea that I would have to take medication every day for the rest of my life.” At the time of diagnosis, I knew only very little about high blood pressure and feels strongly that greater awareness is required. “We hear so much about HIV/Aids, for example, but high blood pressure hardly ever gets any media attention. Permanent lifestyle change. “High blood pressure requires a permanent lifestyle change so said my doctor,” “I continue to exercise and have made many changes to my eating habits. In addition, it’s an ongoing challenge to remember to take my blood pressure medication every single day.” I do forget now and then, especially when am out of the city on business, as is frequently the case. My wife always knows when I’ve missed doses, however, as I apparently exhibit a certain moodiness and agitation whenever I have taken my medication. I’m not sure about the reasons for this, but I latter realized that it was side effect of that medication. But with all these efforts, much positive result wasn’t recorded. More evidence and commitment to managing my high blood pressure was the purchase of a blood pressure monitor and high blood pressure reversal medications ARJUNA PLUS BP PRO. I came in contact with this most effective high blood pressure control medication when I went for a seminar organized by pharmacists at Abuja, after the seminar, I met the guy that organized the seminar, pharmacist Brown, I explained my predicament to him, he quickly introduced ARJUNA PLUS BP PRO and assured me that within few weeks, I will call him for testimony and I won’t stop at that, that rather I would introduce it to all my acquaintances that has such peculiar condition. He’s was right. Now I monitor my blood pressure on a daily basis at home, as keeping track of the readings helps me to feel more in control of this silent killer. “I’m glad to say that with the medication ARJUNA PLUS HB PRO my blood pressure has returned to normal and with that I’m now generally well controlled,”” Thanks to this great herbal supplements without side effect I must confess. As a person I find it very difficult to lay my confidence on any medication, but ARJUNA PLUS BP PRO has proven me wrong. Its one herbal hypertension drug I can recommend to any of my friend, Colleague or you at any time any day. Now that my blood pressure has been controlled, an idea flashed through my head. I thought… if I could beg and reach an agreement with pharmacist Brown, to help send in some packs of the ARJUNA PLUS BP PRO, I could create some awareness for it So that the thousands of people with high blood pressure and heart related problems in this country can get access to it and free themselves from the shackles and discomfort of drugs. Also, I’ll be helping as many people as possible, so that they don’t have to suffer the agony I passed through. As God may have it, I reached out to Pharmacist Brown after few weeks, and immediately he was comfortable with my idea because “health they say is wealth “but was concerned about honesty and sincerity because he has been transferred to India for more research. But I assured him and gave him my words. No reasonable person can play trick with issues concerning health. 2 months later he ordered and shipped in 150 packs of ARJUNA PLUS BP PRO to me. What Happened in my office after receiving the supplement was amazing instantly, on breaking the news to my colleagues. Little did I know that most of them where in my shoes and 48 packs of the ARJUNA PLUS BP PRO were picked up instantly. Some got for their parents, others for themselves and some for friends 2 packs each. Such huge demand followed by those mind-blowing testimonials. “Thank God I could put the subscription to various drugs behind me.” I can hardly believe how well this works. The pack says to take 1 capsule twice daily. I was only taking 5 total capsules per week and I went from an average of 145/85 to about 115/78. Sometimes I am actually down to 106/72 so I am going to reduce the dosage to taking only 3 total capsules per week and see how that works. I assume it will not work this well on everyone but I am a believer. – Mrs. Caroline. – Lekki Lagos “This is an excellent product”. My blood pressure reading before I started taking this supplement was 145/85 now it reads 117/35. I no longer suffer from fatigue and my vision is clear again.

I referred this product to my family members that are also suffering from hypertension. – Alhaji B. – Maitama, (Abuja) After so many years of managing BP problems I can say that I am almost finally free from HBP.
