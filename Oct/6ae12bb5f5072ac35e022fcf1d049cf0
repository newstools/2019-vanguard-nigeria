Useni and his Party, the PDP are maintaining that Governor Simon Lalong was not qualified in the first place to have contested for election into the office of Governor of Plateau State because he supplied false information to INEC in his form CF100. The tribunal in its judgement had acknowledged that its findings also pointed to the fact that the information he  supplied in that form was false.

They also seek an order nullifying the return of the 2nd Respondent as the winner of the Governorship Election and directing INEC to withdraw Simon Bako Lalong’s certificate of return; declare and return Useni as validly elected and issue him a certificate of Return as the duly elected Governor of Plateau State Vanguard The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Governorship candidate  for Plateau State in the general election, Senator Jeremiah Useni has filed a petition at the Governorship election tribunal in Jos, asking the tribunal to declare Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC’s declaration of Governor Simon Lalong of the All Progressives Congress, APC, as… April 15, 2019 In "News" The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Plateau State, in the 2019 elections Senator Jeremiah Useni, and his party, have asked the Governorship Election Tribunal sitting at West of Mines, Jos to declare the candidate of the All Progressives Party, APC, Simon Lalong unqualified to contest the… June 16, 2019 In "News" Immediate past Senator representing Plateau North Senatorial zone, Senator Jonah Jang has expressed sadness over the tribunal judgment which dismissed the petition of the People's Democratic Party, PDP and its governorship candidate, Senator Jeremiah Useni and affirmed Governor Simon Lalong as the duly elected governor of the State.
