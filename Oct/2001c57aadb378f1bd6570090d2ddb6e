This was a very controversial ruling which however led to jubilation A 36-year old Isioma Adeyemi had requested to change her legal status from female to male due to the length of her clitoris. This request was however granted by five-member Supreme Court panel, led by Justice Mary Odili who ruled that her request was “perfectly sound and legitimate”, ordering that her legal status be changed immediately.

Uganda offers the same choice to all women with clitorises longer than 5 centimetres (2 inches). Only 11 women have legally changed their status to men since the law was passed in 2011.
