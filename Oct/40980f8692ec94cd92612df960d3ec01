The Special Adviser (SA) to the Governor on Housing, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, said this in a statement in Lagos on Monday. Benson-Awoyinka said that the state government had planned a stakeholders forum for real estate practitioners, aimed at tackling the menace. She said that the one-day stakeholder’s engagement slated for Wednesday had as its theme ”Lagos Real Estate: Achieving 21st Century Compliance.” The special adviser said that the theme of the forum showed that the state government was making frantic efforts to eradicate the dubious practices of some real estate practitioners in the state.

She, however, said that the present administration was determined to ensure a conducive environment for seamless operation within the sector. ”I implore the real estate/agency businesses to cooperate with the state government so that the state as a smart city would be made investors’ haven, not only in Africa but the world at large,” she said.
