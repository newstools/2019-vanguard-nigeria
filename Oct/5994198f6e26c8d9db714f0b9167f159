Ethiopia has denied that three-way talks are stalled, accusing Egypt of trying to sidestep the process. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to raise the demand for a mediator when he meets Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed during a Russian-African summit in Russia this week. “We’re hoping this meeting might produce an agreement on the participation of a fourth party,” an Egyptian foreign ministry official told journalists at a briefing. “We’re hoping to reach a formula in the next few weeks.” Egyptian officials said they had suggested the World Bank as a fourth party mediator, but were also open to the role being filled by a country with technical experience on water sharing issues such as the United States, or the European Union. Recent proposal put forward by Egypt for a flexible reservoir-filling process and a guaranteed annual flow of 40 billion cubic meters was rejected by Ethiopia. The latest rounds of talks in Cairo and Khartoum over the past two months ended in acrimony. “The gap is getting wider,” the Egyptian foreign ministry official said. Egypt draws almost all of its freshwater supplies from the Nile and is faced with worsening water scarcity for its population of nearly 100 million. It says it is working to reduce the amount of water used in agriculture. Egypt currently has around 570 cubic meters per person per year, a figure that is expected to drop to 500 cubic meters by 2025, without taking into account any reduction in supply caused by GERD, Egyptian officials said. Ethiopia is expected to start filling the GERD reservoir next year.
