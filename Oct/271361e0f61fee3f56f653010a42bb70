Abdulrahman said, “Minimum wage as being handled by the federal government has been nothing but frustration for workers. The percentage increase on the minimum wage is just peanut compared to what politician officeholders fixed for selves. “Look at what the National Assembly earn as salaries side by side with what Nigerian labour unions are asking for workers. It is not encouraging at all for the nation’s workforce.

They should not prolong the matter. When you prolong the matter it tells on your integrity. That is why some of us were not happy when the labour minister (Ngige) was reappointed. We are not comfortable with it. Mr. President can’t do everything, so he appoints people in all these ministries. “When they are so appointed, they play an Advisory role to the President. A minister’s body language determines what the President decides for that ministry.

Abdulrahman also expressed displeasure over the increase in Value Added Tax in Nigeria (VAT), saying, “Even as FIRS staff, we buy from the same market with other Nigerians. Personally, I don’t cherish Nigeria increasing VAT because as long as it will have a multiplier effect on the consumers.” vanguard MINISTER of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed and the Head of Service, Dr Folashade Yemi-Essan and the labour leaders on Wednesday met at the Ministry in Abuja to resolve the controversy over the consequential adjustment for senior government… October 9, 2019 In "Finance" The Nigerian Government has adjusted the salaries of military officers, other security agencies and officers of these agencies are to benefit from the consequential adjustment of workers’ salaries in relation to labour unions agreement.
