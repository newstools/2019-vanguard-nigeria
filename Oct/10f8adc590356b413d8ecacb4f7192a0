Count three of the charge reads: “That you, Paul Boroh and Hanafi, Moriki between the 1st of December 2016 and 30th July, 2017 at Abuja within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court whilst being public servants entrusted with property to wit funds of the Office of the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, dishonestly converted the sum of One Million, Seven Hundred and Fourteen Thousand United States Dollars to your own use and thereby committed an offense contrary to and punishable under section 315 of the Penal Code Law.” They pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against them by the EFCC. Following their plea, counsel to the 1st defendant Mike Ozekhome (SAN) urged the court to grant his client bail on liberal terms, stating that his client willingly brought himself to court despite his failing health. Counsel to the 2nd defendant, O.A Dada also prayed the court to grant his client bail on liberal terms. “The prosecuting counsel, Aisha A.T. Habib opposed the bail applications, stating that a counter affidavit had been filed against the applications and prayed the court to grant the case accelerated hearing. “However, the judge granted the defendants bail in the following terms: while the 1st defendant was offered a N2million bail, the 2nd defendant was granted bail in the sum of N20million. The defendants are to provide two sureties, not below the rank of Assistant Director in the Federal Public Service, who must be resident in Abuja. The defendants are also to deposit their international passports with the court registry. Justice Goodluck thereafter adjourned the case to 26, 27 November and 3, 4 December 2019 for trial,” the statement added.
