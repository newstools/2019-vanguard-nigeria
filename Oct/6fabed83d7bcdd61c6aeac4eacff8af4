It paralysed the capital, Tokyo, and surrounding areas, causing rivers to overflow and leaving almost half a million homes without power. public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday. Rescue efforts were in full force, with troops, boats and helicopters deployed to the flooded areas, as rescue crew dug through dirt in other areas to try to get people out from homes buried by landslides. Hagibis made landfall on the main Japanese island of Honshu around 7 pm (10:00 GMT) on Saturday, with wind gusts of up to 216 kilometres per hour (134 miles per hour). A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after. By Sunday morning, the significantly weakened storm had moved back off the land and was expected to head out to sea in the evening after churning its way along the northern island of Hokkaido. But serious flooding was reported in central Japan’s Nagano, where a burst levee sent water from the Chikuma River gushing into residential neighbourhoods, flooding homes up to the second floor on Sunday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an emergency meeting of relevant ministers and dispatched the minister in charge of disaster management to the worst-hit areas. ⤖No Bra Day: Real reason females celebrate today ⤖15 dead, 2 injured in Burkina Faso mosque attack He offered condolences to the families of those who died and said the government was working to save people’s lives and property. “The government will do everything in its power to cooperate with relevant agencies to restore services as soon as possible,” said Abe. Some 27,000 members of Japan’s self-defence forces, as well as firefighters, police and coast guard members, were sent to rescue stranded people in central Japan’s Nagano prefecture and elsewhere, the government said. Thirteen people were also missing on Sunday, NHK said, adding that the full extent of the damage was only beginning to emerge because many areas remained underwater. Around 425,000 homes were without power, the government said, reviving fears of a repeat of the weeks-long power outages suffered after another typhoon hit east of Tokyo last month.
