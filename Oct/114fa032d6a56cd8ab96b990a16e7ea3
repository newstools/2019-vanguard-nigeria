Nigerians are currently trending the hashtag #keepfisayosafe on twitter, praying for the safety and protection of an Investigative Journalist,  Fisayo Soyombo whose undercover stories exposed the depth of corruption in Nigerian police cells and prison. Fisayo Soyombo, a former editor of TheCable and a contributor to Al Jazeera, in his undercover story, detailed how Nigerian policemen “pervert the course of justice in their quest for ill-gotten money”. Soyombo, during his investigation, went undercover with an alias Ojo Olajumoke. He spent days at a cell at Pedro Police Station, Shomolu, Lagos. He also went to the Ikoyi prison where he spent eight days. His reports contained audio, pictorial and video evidence of corruption in the Nigerian judicial system. It is learnt that Soyombo, scheduled to speak at a workshop on fake news organised by Goethe Institute on Tuesday evening and is to be arrested at the venue of the event and due to the alleged arrest threat, he pulled out of the event. Reports have it that the arrest threat is based under Section 29 of the Nigeria Correctional Service Act. Subsection 1 (d) of the Act states that a person is deemed to have committed an offence if he “procures or facilitates the procurement of communication devices for an inmate or makes conversation or aids the making of conversation through a mobile phone or other devices to an inmate other than as provided in the Correctional Standing Orders and other related correctional policies.” However, Nigerians have questioned why a journalist who exposed corrupt practices in Nigerian prisons should be arrested for doing what he did. They, therefore, called on the government to keep Fisayo Soyombo safe and give media the freedom to operate.
