It is no longer news that businesses cannot prosper in a world plagued with poverty, inequality, violence and environmental stress. According to business tycoons, for companies to excel, they must align themselves with the global development priorities and ensure they fuel and catalyse the global efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs.  The SDGs were adopted precisely on September 25, 2015, by 193 countries as a follow up to the Millennium Development Goals. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1261447 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=640%2C306&#038;ssl=1" alt="SDGs: How NNPC/SEPLAT is changing lives in communities" width="640" height="306" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=1024%2C489&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=768%2C367&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=58%2C28&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=260%2C124&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=200%2C95&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?resize=560%2C267&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Malnourished.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Worldwide, corporate organisations are now key drivers of SDGs.

In the views of one of the beneficiaries, Mr. Emeka  Alozie: “Yesterday, I had surgery on my left eye. Today the patch which was placed on the eye was taken off.” The 65-year-old man who was covering his right eye with one of his hands said his vision has improved. “It is a miracle. Thank you Seplat,” he said. At Izombe, over sixty men and women had eye surgeries, got medication or recommended glasses from Seplat free- of- charge as a result of this outreach.
