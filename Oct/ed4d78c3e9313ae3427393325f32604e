As a result of the downpour, motorists and commuters were trapped in traffic across the state. In one of the worst-hit areas, Orile-Agege, a concerned resident of Orile-Agege, Johnson Babatunde, told Vanguard that the pupils of Ladoje Nursery and Primary School in the area could not leave the premises because of the intensity of the rain. “There is need for government to rescue the affected persons and pupils at Ladoje Nursery and Primary School who were trapped in the premises due to heavy flood,” Babatunde stated. ⤖Flood renders people homeless in Akeredolu’s mother’s hometown ⤖My daughter is still alive, trapped, Ondo flood victim’s father says Vanguard later gathered that the pupils were later rescued through community effort when they were moved to safe ground through a makeshift canoe.
