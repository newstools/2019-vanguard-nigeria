The tribunal also awarded cost of N300,000 against the petitioners to be paid to each of the Respondents in the case, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Governor Wike. The tribunal will shortly deliver another judgement on the petition filed by the African Action Congress (AAC) and its Rivers Governorship Candidate, Biokpomabo Awara, also seeking nullification of Governor Wike’s victory in the same election.
