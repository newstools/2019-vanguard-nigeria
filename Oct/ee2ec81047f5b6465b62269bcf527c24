Scientists at Australia’s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research developed a new compound that could be a game-changer for medical emergencies and surgeries to prevent cells from dying. The new compound is able to keep cells, which would normally die as a result of the natural process called apoptosis, alive and functioning.

Created after an 11-year research collaboration involving government funding and various health organisations, study lead, Prof. David Huang, said the discovery could be invaluable for the future of medical care. “Acute injury can cause cells to die rapidly leading to the loss and weakening of tissues and muscles,’’ he said on Tuesday. “In such circumstances, being able to prevent uncontrolled cell death could improve a patient’s recovery, or even their chances of survival.’’ I tell the story of my life with my sculptures – Aidelokha Iziogba(Opens in a new browser tab) Now with the ability to intervene in the earliest stages of apoptosis, before irreversible damage occurs, Huang added that the next phases of research on the compound will involve “applying the knowledge we have gained to more advanced models of disease’’. “There could be applications for keeping cells alive to prevent degenerative diseases,’’ he said.  (NAN) Vanguard Australian scientists on Thursday said they have taken a crucial step toward in developing a new malaria vaccine by using a novel “atomic-scale” blueprint to track how the parasite invades human cells. June 28, 2018 In "Health" Some Australian researchers from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, said they had discovered a way to stop the malaria parasite invading healthy red blood cells. July 1, 2016 In "News" Scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘game-changer’ in the battle against the disease. They have worked out how to teach the body’s immune system to identify cancer cells, allowing patients to be primed to destroy cancer. In one case an American… March 28, 2015 In "Health"
