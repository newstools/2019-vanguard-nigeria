The event titled “Breaking Barriers, Tax Justice and Gender Responsive Public Service was organised by ActionAid Nigeria. Ahmad said that the state government decided to establish the schools because of a shortage of schools for people with special needs. “Currently, we have only one school for persons with special needs in the state; such persons are not allowed admission in other schools. “ As a state, we need to properly address the needs of this category of persons so that they can be adequately trained, ” he said.
