The Umuhaia born suspect, who is a trader said; “I am a trader and I sell my clothes and footwears at Ojota, Market in Lagos State.  I used to buy my wears, Ariaha Market, in Aba, but a few months ago, my phone was stolen, in Aba town, while I was sleeping in one of my trips and someone took me to native doctor who said he could prepare charms for me that would make the person who stole my phone to return it back to me.   I bought the phone for N70,000 and the native doctor asked me to pay N30,000 for the charm and I gave him the money, but seven days after I made the payment, the person didn’t return my phone. I went back to the native doctor and informed him that his charms didn’t work and he asked me to pay an addition N7000 so he can consult his oracle to know why his charms didn’t work. I refused and insisted that he should refund my money and he told me that he has given me money to his gods.  I told him that was his business and that he should refund my money to me. He then inserted my money into a box and sprayed some powered on it, before handing it over to me. I took the money from him and I went to play a sports betting shop and I gambled with all the money.” “I got frustrated after I lost all my money to gambling then one of my friends, known as Udo approached me and told me that he has a robbery operation that he wanted me to take part in and he said I would replace my lost phone from the job and also raise some money for my business.  He also asked me to invite one other person and I brought in my cousin brother   Chukwuebuka” “On the day of the robbery my brother brought a cutlass and Udo and his friend Kaita brought three cutlasses and a locally-made gun. We attacked a three-story building in Osisioama area of Aba first and Udo and his friend entered into the house, while my brother and I waited outside.  They stole some phones and Udo told us that there was another building we have to rob and the owner has lots of money and gold jewellery in his house.  He also told me that he has once robbed the man and collected two phones from the man in the past and he would want my brother and me to enter into the man’s house because the man knows him very well. when we got to man’s compound, we met the doors open and we entered inside and met the man, his wife and their made.  We pointed our gun at him and we demanded money, his phones and the gold jewellery. He gave us N250,000 in cash and he brought out all his gold jewellery because we threatened to kill him if he doesn’t comply with our request. I then raped his housemaid.  I don’t know what came over me when I did it.  I also wanted to rape his wife but I left her because she was a nursing mother.  I got a Samsung phone and the sum of N100,000 as my share a and I didn’t bother about the gold. It was after I was arrested that I learned that the gold jewellery has a market value of N3.9million “ he lamented.

I was taken to prison where I spent three months that was in 2017.  After I came back from prison, one of my friends gave me links to work as a security man for a lawyer and after working for him and he refused to pay me my salary and I stole his wife’s bag and his phone.  I spent one month in the prison and when I came out I have vowed to turn a new leaf after I was released from prison but my brother got me involved in this operation. The boys who brought the job told me that the man we robbed his house has gold and much money which he flaunts around town and I would make good money from the job.  After the operation. I got only N100,000 as my share after the gold was sold and I didn’t get any reasonable money.  it was when I was arrested that I learned that the gold was worth, N3.9million.  additionally I didn’t sleep with the maid during the operation, it was my brother that raped the maid.
