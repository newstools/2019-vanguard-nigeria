If we are tightening our belts, the government should also do so. “By the agreement reached, the core civil servants:- GL 7 (23.2%), GL 8 -(20%), GL 9 – (19%), GL 10-14 – (16%) and GL 15-17 (14%). ” Others, GL -7 (23.2%) like above; 8-14 shall earn (16%) and 15-17 (10.5). As an organization and a major stakeholder in the Nigerian project, we believe that the parties have done well. We shifted grounds and that is why we were able to resolve things without major injuries. It is a win-win situation. “The TUC boss said he is particularly happy with the agreement because it has addressed some salary discrepancies and overlapping that the workers have agitated so much about. ” This is a unique agreement and we promise to build on that by God’s grace.”.
