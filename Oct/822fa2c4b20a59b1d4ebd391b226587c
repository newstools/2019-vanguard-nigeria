The minister explained that the government was working hard to ensure efficiency in existing revenue streams while searching for new ones. She said the government would consult with all stakeholders on the proposal in line with standard policy formulation process. “Any tax that you are introducing will involve a lot of consultations and also amendments of some laws or introduction of new regulations,” she said.

Ahmed said her ministry was working with all the agencies to ensure that collaboration was strengthened in revenue generation. “The government is trying to ensure that the work of the agencies are complementing each other as opposed to the past where everybody is working in silos. “Efforts are ongoing to improve the monitoring performance of the revenue generating agencies, especially government-owned enterprises. “We have now in place a rigorous monthly reconciliation of revenues and that is ensuring that the leakages are minimised. ⤖Budget defence: Senate adjourns plenary till Oct. 29 ⤖APC belongs to us; we are going nowhere, Obaseki reaffirms “There is several cost-cutting measures in the SRGI and a number of cost cutting measures initiatives such as innovation and automation as well as capacity building of our people,” she said.
