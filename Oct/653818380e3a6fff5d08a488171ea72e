A statement issued at the end of the meeting by Dr. Ayo Adewunmi, Art Director of the Festival noted that the appointment of Essien is in continuation of the trend set from the beginning of the Festival 13 years ago. The statement noted that in the last three years a deliberate policy directed by the Board of Trustees had also resulted in the inclusion of younger talents from the pool of past overall winners who have distinguished themselves and advanced their careers notably further, to join the regional and the national jury panels. The aim is to ensure continuity and help build leadership in the Nigeria art landscape both in academia as well as among studio practitioners and in the art industry generally. Adewunmi added that LIMCAF’s in this regard is to continue to contribute significantly to the robust growth of the art industry in Nigeria.
