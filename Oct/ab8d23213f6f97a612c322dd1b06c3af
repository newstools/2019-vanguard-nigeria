The statistics were released as part of a social media campaign to highlight the risk of STDs among all age groups, including the elderly. Age UK are striving to see improved access to health services for older people and more support to those who wish to remain sexually active. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said: “Sex continues to be important for many of us well into old age, but for some reason, the whole topic remains taboo in some circles. “This is a shame and it also means that sexually active older people are at greater risk of STIs than they need to be or ought to be. Health professionals should be open about discussing sexual health with older people and certainly not immediately jump to the conclusion that sex is irrelevant once you pass a certain birthday. “Public health messages around sexual health and STI prevention also need to recognise the reality that sex is a part of many people’s later lives and aim to be inclusive of people of all ages.” Vanguard The number of syphilis patients in Japan has risen to 6,096, this year, a 47-year-high, the Tokyo-based National Institute of Infectious Diseases reported on Wednesday.
