Jadon Sancho would struggle to get into Bayern Munich’s team, according to Franck Ribery. The former France international, who spent 12 trophy-laden years in Bavaria, insists that Munich have no need to try and prise Sancho away from their rivals Borussia Dortmund. Sancho, 19, is enjoying another prosperous year in Germany and has found the back of the net on three occasions in seven games this season, DailyMail reported. Ribery, who now plays his football in Italy with Fiorentina, rates Sancho as one of the best in the league but does not believe he is any better than what Bayern have already got in their ranks. ⤕Jailed El Salvador ex-president gets two more years for bribery ⤕Akpabio dissociates self from bribery allegation against tribunal judges “Sancho is a good player, but Bayern have enough good players in this position – where should he play?” Ribery told Sport Bild. “There is [Thomas] Muller, [Serge] Gnabry, [Ivan] Perisic, [Kingsley] Coman, [Philippe] Coutinho, [Robert] Lewandowski. There is a lot of competition. I hope Sancho confirms his good year, but there would be little room for him in the Bayern squad.” Vanguard News Nigeria.
