Cities account for just 2% of global land area but are responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. As such, Sage Innovation Centre seeks well-defined climate-smart solutions at the Minimum Viable Product Stage that can support cities in reducing their emission goals and/or increasing their resilience to climate change impacts,” she said. The Sage founder further revealed her passion for supporting climate-smart cities – those that are low-carbon and climate-resilient – as a critical part of addressing climate change. “Becoming a climate-smart city requires an integrated approach that combines planning, policy, regulation, and investment. The pitch hub reflects my passion to help plug innovative ideas into our ecosystem of experts ready to build climate-smart cities,” she said. She further explains that submissions can be goods, services (e.g. financial instruments, risk management mechanisms), technological solutions, or innovative business models that can be applied in one of the urban focus areas such as Disaster Risk Management, Energy, Efficiency, Food, Finance, Health, Information Technology, Infrastructure, Mobility, Planning, Waste, Water.
