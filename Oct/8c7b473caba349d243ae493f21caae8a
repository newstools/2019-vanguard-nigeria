According to him, what would matter would be the competitiveness of the country and businesses operating in the country, while he noted that all efforts should be geared towards making the country commercially competitive.

Akinwuntan further stated that Nigeria’s epileptic power supply situation would be an impediment to our competitiveness, as countries that have the capacity in electricity generation and distribution would export electricity to Nigeria. He said, “All ports in Nigeria, seaports, railway, airports and others, must be favourable for people to move their goods and services. It is about attracting other parts of Africa to do business with us. Today, it is faster to ship goods from Europe to Apapa than to move goods from Apapa to Ikeja. “Nigeria is bordered by French-speaking countries and most of us do not know how to speak French, whereas majority of the educated people in these French-speaking countries can speak English. If we want to compete under the AfCFTA, we must be bi-lingual, we must at least, learn to speak French.” The Ecobank chief executive added that Nigeria must see the entire Africa as a market, and focus on changing the cost and ease of exporting goods and services from what it is currently. Also speaking, Chief Executive Officer of Flour Mills of Nigeria Limited, Mr. Paul Gbededo, disclosed that Nigeria cannot export goods and services if our products are not able to compete globally price-wise. He argued that the AfCFTA was an opportunity for Nigeria to up its game, as well as ensure that it is competitive in pricing and quality.

Nigeria should look beyond its borders and utilise more of its capacity. “The ports and railways need to improve their services, while the government should develop critical infrastructure in every sectors of the economy.” Vanguard Ecobank Nigeria yesterday said that Patrick Akinwuntan will take over from Charles Kie as its new Managing Director/Chief Executive.
