The Chairman of the Agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi said the erring persons have since been paraded for flouting traffic regulations and riding along restricted routes. He stated that the agency was compelled to embark on the clampdown of motorcycles due to the enormous complaints that reached him about the illegal activities of the motorcyclists and the rate at which they ride carelessly, thereby putting lives of motorists and pedestrians in danger. CSP Egbeyemi disclosed that the clampdown would stretch down to all axis of Victoria Island, Ajah, Lekki to put a check to the illegal operations and plying of restricted routes on that axis. He further said the routes being plied are restricted in accordance with the Lagos Traffic Laws which states that every motorcycle operator must wear crash helmets, be above 18 years, not ride on kerb/median/road setbacks, avoid restricted routes, not carry more than one passenger/pregnant woman/Adult with baby/Child below 12 years, not install any musical gadgets, must wear an apron, not operate beyond 10pm, operate with a rider’s permit and have their motorcycle registered with Government. He harped on the recklessness of the ORide motorcyclists who are gradually becoming a problem on our roads by driving against traffic, riding on the flyover and not minding the casualties that might occur. He admonished them to adhere to the Lagos traffic rules in the course of their activities. He expressed the readiness of the agency to ensure that the Lagos Traffic Regulations are adhered to in all areas of the state by all commercial motorcycle operators and ensure that the safety of pedestrians is not jettisoned by defiant riders. vanguard Operatives of the Lagos State Taskforce have impounded 109 commercial motorcycles, popularly called okada, for operating on restricted routes at Second Rainbow, along Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, Lagos State.
