The horrific incident was carried out during a nap hour when all the children were sleeping. The man identified by Russian news reports as Denis Pozdeev, 36, entered a kindergarten in Naryan-Mar, a sea and river port town north of the Arctic Circle in Nenets Autonomous region. Security at ‘Skazka’ kindergarten didn’t stop the man as he walked inside the room where children were having late afternoon nap. Screaming ‘Satan ordered me to do it!’, Pozdeev attacked one of the kids sleeping in a corner bed, slashing his neck with a knife. The boy died minutes after the attack in the arms of the kindergarten nannies. Kindergarten security detained the attacker and held him until police arrived. The victim was later identified as Kirill Savenkov, aged 6. He was in the last kindergarten year in Russia before starting school. The boy’s devastated father Konstantin said the kindergarten contacted his wife Yelena to tell them about the tragedy. During the first interrogation by authorities, Pozdeev said it was ‘voices in his head’ that made him commit the crime. He was high on either alcohol or drugs, Naryan-Mar media reported. Pozdeev was not related to the child and claimed that he walked into the kindergarten ‘by accident’ because he was ‘hallucinating’. He said that the took the sleeping child to be a monster, and attacked. During a search of his flat, police found pieces of paper with basic information about the ‘Skazka’ kindergarten, its working hours and information on a number of children in playgroups. Three criminal cases were started by the Russian Investigative Committee on several clauses of the Russian Criminal Code including: ‘Murder of a minor’, ‘Negligence’ and ‘Prosivion of services that don’t meet health and safety requirements’.
