But counsel to Senator Smart Adeyemi, Mr. Dapo Otitoju said the mutilation of result sheet was done by INEC in connivance with Melaye’s men to cover up the rigging. He also said the 48,200 over voting that was detected in the election was uncovered through INEC certified true copy of PVC distributed in the senatorial axis. He said the rigging was carried out in such bad light that the result of the election issued read February 26, 2019 instead of February 23, 2019 when the election was conducted. He therefore prayed the appeal court to disregard the Melaye’s appeal and uphold the tribunal’s judgment, saying the appeal was incompetent and lacking in merit. Tribunal Chairman, Justice Dantijo in his judgment affirmed the tribunal’s verdict and asked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to withdraw the certificate of return given to Senator Dino Melaye and conduct a fresh election within the time frame of the law.
