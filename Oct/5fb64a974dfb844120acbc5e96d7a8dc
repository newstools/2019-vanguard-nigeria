Even a blind man will know that things have fallen apart in our food production as we are not producing enough to feed our citizens.” Ngige to labour: Your letter to SGF, a declaration of trade dispute(Opens in a new browser tab) Oyekoya added that inability to produce enough led to the importation of over 80% of the country’s food need, “we are a consumable nation with foreign taste thereby wasting our meagre foreign reserves on food importation when we can produce them in our arable land.” The Bama farm boss said the minister should tell the nation the number of farms he has visited since his appointment to interact with local farmers before making the statement. “He should have visited farms and see for himself if our local farmers are doing well and would have known there is a problem in the Agric sector. “The minister should have visited the markets and see how exorbitant our foodstuffs are and out of the reach of common man. We don’t have to import foods if we are producing enough and prices of these commodities will not be this high. “How many agriculture stakeholders has the minister met with to assess the situation in the sector.

He added “In the sixties and seventies, Nigeria used to be self sufficient in some of the leading cash crops like cocoa, oil palm, rubber, groundnuts, among others, but now we are no more instead, we import some of these products now into the country. We import ordinary tomatoes pastes, toothpicks, rice, palm oil, vegetable oil. Nigeria is far from food sufficiency.” Vanguard A former Chairman of Agriculture, Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry, LCCI, Prince Wale Oyekoya, in this interview, says Nigeria has viable policies that could uplift the agriculture sector in next four years but insisted that proper monitoring of the implementation is required to achieve results.
