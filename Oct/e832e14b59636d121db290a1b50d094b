CEO of Zee TV Africa, Harish Goyal has explained why they featured African actors in their landmark series, ‘Mehek’, saying the decision was based on popular demand. Speaking at a recent press parley to announce their lineup showS for 2020, Goyal said many African viewers of the series have been asking them why they are not telling their own local stories.
