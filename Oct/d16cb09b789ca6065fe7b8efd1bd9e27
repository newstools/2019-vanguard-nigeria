Speaking to newsmen after the ruling yesterday in Abuja, Akpodiete affirmed that “As a minister in the temple of justice, I cannot criticize the decision of His Lordship, and I also cannot take my grievances over the exorbitant and unconstitutional nomination fees to the market women in Oshodi Market in Lagos or Wuse market here in Abuja, I will approach the Court of Appeal immediately and I believe I will get justice in the days ahead. I am confident that justice will be done at last and I shall wait for it patiently.” Oshiomhole denies, blames PDP for 2023 presidential posters of party members(Opens in a new browser tab) “We will not allow a group of political oligarchs to promote injustice and ridicule our courts and constitution. The guidelines of the political party is in conflict with the provisions of the 1999 constitution as amended in 2010, and section 1 (3) provides that any other law that is in conflict with the constitution must bow,” he fumed.
