According to him, the command exceeded its revenue target of Ten Million by about 8.2 per cent in the first two quarters of the year, adding that it is set to do better even in this last quarter. The bulk of the revenue collected was realised from import duties mainly on Dry fish, Gum Arabic, sesame seeds, groundnut, cake, potash, live animals, beans and polypropylene. The comptroller, however, cited the activities of the Boko- Haram insurgents, and the incessant attacks on trader and security agencies along Gamboru, Banki and Geidam axis as one of the challenges facing the command. ” Another factor mitigating against the customs operation in this command is the vast porous sandy terrain borders that require the use of special purpose vehicles, the mine infested trade routes and lack of viable cottage industries that could generate exercise revenue,” he said He said the custom command seized different contraband items like rice, vegetable oil, sugar, second-hand vehicles, soap, second-hand clothing and used tyres valued at over 20 million Naira. Commending other sister security agencies for their cooperation, Malla Aliyu Abdullahi said with the hard push against Boko Haram Insurgents by the army, the revenue profile of the command is likely going to increase in the coming months.
