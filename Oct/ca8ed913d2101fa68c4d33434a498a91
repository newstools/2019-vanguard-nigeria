They believe that “an earlier dispute occurred inside the bar”, which led to the shooting just before 01:30 local time (06:30 GMT). “The suspects were armed with handguns and fled the scene,” Kansas City Kansas Police Department (KCKPD) said. Earlier, the local police told the BBC that a suspect was a Hispanic man. An investigation is continuing. So far this year, the US has been hit by more than 40 mass shootings defined since 2012 as incidents that killed at least three people. The KCKPD said in its statement that police officers were despatched “to the 1000 block of Central Avenue (Tequila KC)” after receiving first reports of a shooting, BBC report. Tequila KC refers to a bar in central Kansas City, local media report. “Upon arrival, we located a total of nine people that had been shot. Four of the victims were found deceased inside of the business and five were found outside with injuries, all due to gunshots,” the KCKPD said. About 40 people were inside the bar at the time of the shooting, according to a police estimate. ⤕Thousands throng New York streets for Nigerian Independence Parade ⤕4 homeless men beaten to death with pipe in New York City More than one gunman may have been involved, and it is possible the perpetrator was at the bar earlier and had returned to carry out the attack, police spokesman Thomas Tomasic said.
