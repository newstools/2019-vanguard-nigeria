He won consecutive tour matches for the first time since his hip resurfacing surgery in January. The Scot beat eighth-seeded Italian Matteo Berrettini 7-6(2) 7-6(7) in the first round on Tuesday and now meets world number five Thiem who beat Chinese wildcard Zhizhen Zhang 6-3 6-3. “I’m really tired, I just had a sleep before coming,” Murray said. “That’s the first time I’ve had to do that since I came back. “It’s something that I need to kind of get used to again, especially playing at this level and that intensity. “It was a good step for me, it’s great that I won the match. Whether I’d won or lost it, I was able to come out… and be competitive and play some good tennis… I’m happy I’ve got the day off tomorrow to recover.” Norrie served poorly compared to the former world number one but 32-year-old Murray only managed to convert four of 13 break points in the match. Serving for the opening set at 5-3, Murray was broken by Norrie, who then saved three set points in the ensuing tiebreak before he double faulted on the Scot’s fourth set point.

Murray then switched tactics, coming up to the net more often to dictate rallies and shorten points, and won the first five games in a row to set up a meeting with Thiem. The Austrian fired five aces, won 84% of his first service points and needed only three breaks to beat Zhang in 69 minutes. Italy’s Fabio Fognini beat Russian Andrey Rublev 6-3 6-4 to set up a quarter-final clash with fourth seed Karen Khachanov, who dispatched Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 7-6(0) 7-6(5).  (NAN) Vanguard Andy Murray secured his fifth singles title of 2016 and the 40th of his career by beating Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 7-6 (7-2) in the China Open final on Sunday.
