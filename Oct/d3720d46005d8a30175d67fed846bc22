Ekele said child spacing was hugely beneficial to effective growth of children and future planning. The TCI coordinator said that longer birth intervals reduced the chances of low birth weight, saying “the mother will have time to recover physically after childbirth”. According to her, allowing time before another pregnancy enables the woman to give proper attention to the children. “Birth spacing benefits the family hugely; it can protect the child and the mother against the danger of loss of life. “It improves the health of the child and that of the mother, it promotes family health and happiness,” she said. Ekele commended a Bauchi-based drama group (Yanke Yanke) for its use of theatre in sensitising communities on the advantages of childbirth spacing. Alhaji Auwal Jatau, the state Commissioner for Health, described the event as `educative and highly informative’. “Child spacing is an important aspect of family and parenthood planning, it reduces infant and maternal mortality rate,” he said. ⤖Nigeria may not achieve Universal Health Coverage until… — Prof. Akin Abayomi ⤖Birth Registration: Why many children in Lagos have no identity The commissioner urged traditional and religious institutions in the state to join the crusade on effective child spacing. “The involvement of these institutions will deepen the spread of this message to the grassroots,” he said.
