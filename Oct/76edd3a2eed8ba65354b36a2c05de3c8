Addressing women in Enugu State during the monthly prayer rally held at Michael Okpara Square, Enugu, Mrs. Ugwuanyi noted that this month’s event was dedicated to creating awareness of cancer and campaign against it. She pointed out that early detection of cancer is the best way to tackle the disease and urged the women to disseminate the information to their loved ones and other people in their neighborhoods. Mrs. Ugwuanyi maintained that the monthly prayer session has remained a veritable platform to identify with God and offer prayers for the state as well as “put smiles on the faces of people” through worthy advice, assistance, and presentation of gift items. The Enugu Governor’s wife disclosed that her empowerment programme which is being driven by her pet project, Ugo’s Touch of Life Foundation (U-TOLF), is aimed at assisting people especially the less privileged to earn a better living.
