We sponsored the Nigeria Prize for Science and the Nigeria Prize for Literature worth $100,000 each, sponsored of scholarships, health initiatives, and built infrastructure in Bonny Island, our host community and more.” Mrs Fatayi-Williams said: “NLNG is celebrating 30 years of incorporation this year. At the same time, we are also celebrating 20 years of safe and reliable production and delivery of LNG to the world. These milestones are what have made 2019 a very special and auspicious year for us all. “Never before has our history been told the way it has been done this year, showing you in clarity how Nigeria built this company into success. A number stands out in all of these narratives; the number 30. “The significance in this is that in our history, major developments and milestones are in blocks of 30 years.  Starting in the 1960s, it took about 30 years of false, botched starts before the NLNG concept gained traction, and the company was incorporated in 1989. From that time, it took another 30 years of developing what you currently see as Nigeria LNG. We have signed FIDs, which paved the way for our current 22 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) plant.” She stated: “The second block of 30 ends this year. We are now in transition, looking into the future and planning for the next 30 years. Train 7 is part of that plan. Train 7 will increase of our production output by 35 per cent from 22 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) to 30 MTPA- another 30 for us. Our future is our growth agenda and that is being a top quartile LNG supplier.  We are fast making progress on this. “This year, we prepare for the future, to regain our position in the ranks of LNG producers worldwide and to regain our reputation in the world, as the fastest growing LNG plant in the world. We are committed to bringing value to both our shareholders, which includes the Federal Government, and our stakeholders.”  THE Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited, International Oil Companies, labour and other stakeholders have kicked against the recent amendment of the NLNG Act by the House of Representatives.
