We cannot leave our senatorial district in the hand of someone who has no solid moral foundation of life, or a drug addict, or someone with questionable family background and characters. “I will rebuild the Kogi west image and serve you with dignity. Vote for APC, APC is for development. Vote for me because I am a man of proven integrity. “I went to the National Assembly and returned with national honour. My antecedents as a legislator and former NUJ President speaks for me. I will correct the mistakes and character of a man that claimed to represent us.” Adeyemi, however, urged the people of the senatorial district to defend their vote so as not to have a repeat of the manipulation of 2015 and 2019. While enumerating his achievements as a two-term senator, he said if given the chance he would do more to eradicate poverty and attract more development to his constituency. “I sponsored up to 50 bills and 100 of motions. One of the bills is the establishment of revenue board for FCT that was left hanging for 15 years.  I built the stadium used for this rally in Kabba, I procured 22 ambulances and 100 of hospital beds and mattresses. The list is endless. “Throw out the rascal, and I will redeem your image,” Adeyemi submitted. vanguard Senator Smart Adeyemi has closed his case before the National/House of Assembly Election Tribunal where he challenged the pronouncement of Senator Dino Melaye as the winner of Kogi West 2019 senatorial election.
