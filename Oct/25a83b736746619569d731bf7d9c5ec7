Speaking on the development, a medical personnel from the Benue State Health Management Board deployed to the camps, who spoke on condition of anonymity attributed the surge in cases of malaria in the camps to the rainy season. “It is rainy season when incidents of malaria is high and you know the number of the IDPs, their condition and situation in the camps. The state government and SEMA are obviously overwhelmed, what we have in Benue state is too much a burden for the state government. “And from our interactions with the IDPs they are eager to go back to their ancestral homes but the challenge is that they do not have homes to return to because they were all destroyed and razed by armed herdsmen. Some of the villages are also still being occupied by the herdsmen, it is a pathetic situation. “Efforts should be made to rebuild the destroyed communities to enable them return home and continue with their normal lives,” he stated.
