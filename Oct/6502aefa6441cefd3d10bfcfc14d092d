Power Nigeria is the largest energy event in West Africa.  It is an annual hub for suppliers to meet buyers, driving both the West African and Nigerian energy markets. Some of the experts who spoke to Hi-Tech after a panel session at the event, said it was time to harness the power of technology to drive the energy sector, even as they charged government to ensure deployment of digitized infrastructure by entrenching use of data management to solve problems of energy consumption, transforming existing grid to smart grid and building a robust and resilient grid . For instance, MD EKEDC, Engr. Adeoye Fadeyibi, said: “With the current consumption of energy in Nigeria, I believe that it is time for energy systems to be designed in such a way that optimisation is guaranteed as well as digitalisation of the grid.” He however admitted that the government has recognised the need for a smart and flexible energy system, as it puts plans in motion to transform the way energy, particularly electricity, is produced, consumed and stored in the country.

He described the situation as a reflection of an inefficient energy system. Ogunsemowo said: “The sun is shining on Nigeria’s renewable energy and as part of our strategy; we understand that technology plays a key role in accelerating access to clean and renewable energy in Nigeria.” Vanguard In line with its commitment to bring about growth and efficiency in the Energy Sector, the Sahara Power Group will join other power sector thought leaders to address the industry's challenges and opportunities at the 2018 edition of Light Up Nigeria Energy Conference. May 11, 2018 In "News" The problem of Nigerian power sector is increasingly becoming critical. At least, more than half of the country’s population has no access to the grid-connected electricity and those who are connected to the grid experience constant blackouts. August 28, 2019 In "Technology" Nigeria’s electricity sector is still under the pressures of weak gas supply which has also affected other sectors of the economy, especially some large scale industrial sectors such as cement manufacturing.
