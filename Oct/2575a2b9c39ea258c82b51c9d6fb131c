He passed entrance exams with flying colours after being home-schooled by his father Robert Bamfo. He told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme that he has ambitions for Ghana’s top job: “I want to become the President of Ghana, I want to lift high the flag of Ghana and make Ghana a truly independent country like China, the US, Britain and other countries.” He hopes to study constitutional law, the political systems of administration, principals of management, economics and accounting.
