He also added that the election should be seen as a game and not war, and every candidate should have the spirit of sportsmanship, decency and discipline. He said: “Bayelsa Peace Initiative, BAPI, is an apolitical non-profit making organization made up of eminent personalities who are ambassadors of peace with high sense of patriotism. We have taken it upon ourselves as major stakeholders of the Bayelsa Project who will not give any place for elements to truncate the peace of our state and also to create animosity among our people because of the governorship election. “The governorship election in Bayelsa State is to be done with dignity and patriotism and not with violence and intimidation as it is been done by some politicians and supporters. “Guns, knives, cutlasses, and axes are not electoral materials. Please our young people, don’t accept them from whoever is promising you position or money to take lives or your life be taken prematurely. Please do not allow yourself to be cheap for them to manipulate you and become their sacrificial lamb. “Violence and hate speech have stunted Bayelsa’s progress over the years. Election is not cult war. Let our young people not be carried away with what their leaders are telling them but should be concerned about their future by allowing peace to reign and maintained for the betterment of the state. He also added that, “Bayelsa is too small to be burnt up with hate speech, blackmail and weapons of destruction. We all have a mandate to ensure a peaceful electoral process as political parties in the state have signed a peace accord that is commendable, but most importantly is to drive it home to their supporters across the eight local government areas of the state and to ensure the uphold it and if any party is found wanton should be dealt with according to the agreement reached under the Electoral Act as Amended in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution. “Also the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, security agencies, political actors, supporters, election observers, and the electorates are to prove themselves as mature and focused organisations that would not allow themselves to be used to truncate the electoral process.” According to him BAPI has embarked on campaign for peaceful governorship election and have engagements with relevant stakeholders. “We have commenced our own campaign for peaceful elections and we are reaching out to all grassroots supporters and relevant youth, women, religious and traditional organisations to ensure peace and sportsmanship before, during and after the election,” he said.
