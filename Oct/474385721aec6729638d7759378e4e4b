The blob also has almost 720 sexes, can move without legs or wings and heals itself in two minutes if cut in half. “The blob is a living being which belongs to one of nature’s mysteries”, said Bruno David, director of the Paris Museum of Natural History, of which the Zoological Park is part. “It surprises us because it has no brain but is able to learn and if you merge two blobs, the one that has learned will transmit its knowledge to the other,” David added. The blob was named after a 1958 science-fiction horror B-movie, starring a young Steve McQueen, in which an alien life form – The Blob – consumes everything in its path in a small Pennsylvania town. “We know for sure it is not a plant but we don’t really if it’s an animal or a fungus,” said David. “It behaves very surprisingly for something that looks like a mushroom, it has the behavior of an animal, it is able to learn.” Source: Reuters Vanguard News As the government of President Muhammadu Buhari looks to diversifying Nigeria’s economy arising from the fall in oil revenue, one area that the country should look into for the much needed succour for the people is eco tourism, with zoological gardens and parks taking the lead in terms of visitor… March 14, 2016 In "Sports" Another shocking story making the rounds, after last year’s JAMB money-swallowing snake, has claimed that a big Gorilla swallowed N6.8 million in the Kano Zoological Gardens during Sallah celebration.
