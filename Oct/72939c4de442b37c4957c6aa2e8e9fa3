Alhaji Atiku Abubakar was the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 2019 presidential election. Speaking on Wednesday, October 30, just minutes after the Supreme Court threw out the appeal by Atiku, Obi said: “My reaction is first, to most sincerely thank all Nigerians who have followed the election and voted. I again thank them for this court process,” he said. The Supreme Court, after the ruling by a seven-man panel, announced that a later date would be given to explain why the court threw out the appeal. Peter Obi also, noted: “Our reason for coming to court is because we believe that the election…the result was not the result of lawful votes cast. “But the process has come to the end. I thank all those who were involved – the lawyers, the judges, all of you, the Fourth Estate. “This election and the judgement are not about President Buhari or His Excellency, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. It is about the future of our country and what we are going to bequeath on our children. It is about our country.” Watch video below: Vanguard Nigeria News Former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan has appealed to the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South East zone to support the party's presidential candidate Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in his choice of Mr. Peter Obi as his running mate, to ensure victory for PDP in next year's general… October 14, 2018 In "News" Following its decision to contest the outcome of the Presidential elections, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, barring any sudden change in plans, will file its petition at the election Tribunal Abuja today.
