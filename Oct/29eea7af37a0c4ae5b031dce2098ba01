They  are in NAPTIP shelter. Out of the  26 girls that were given to us, 22 were pregnant between four to eight months and right now we’re taking care of them, feeding them, they are  having their antenatal care. After their babies are born we’ll know the right steps to take but right now we are interested in making sure they are healthy and have their babies safely, while we go after the traffickers. “ There is a woman called Madam Oluchi Eze, the  major king pin ,who is on the run and but her two accomplices right  are in custody. I am using this  opportunity to call on Madam Oluchi Eze, or anyone who has any useful information on her  to report to NAPTIP so she can be arrested accordingly”. She also disclosed that within 16 years,. The agency had rescued 17,000 victims of human trafficking, adding that  404 human traffickers had been convicted within the period. The rescued human trafficking victims according to her, had undergone counseling, adding that most of them had been empowered in different skills. Those trained from primary school to the University level, she said, were employed by the agency. The NAPTIP DG also disclosed that the Sex Offenders Register , would be formerly launched soon. She explained that the concept was aimed at naming and shaming of sex offenders in Nigeria. She said, “The idea is to  name and shame sex offenders  and also to share their information with very critical sectors. For  example we don’t want pedophile working in a school where we have little girls. We don’t want a pedophile to  work as a counselor where you have victims who are traumatized. So, the idea is to have this register and share it so that when they are looking for jobs they would not be taken in sensitive jobs that require extra caution”. She explained that the two-day workshop was  to strengthen the capacity of state and non-state institutions to assist,  support and protect victims of human  trafficking in Nigeria, noting that the agency’s resolve to end it remained  was firm, as it would continue to engage with various actors across board to achieve its desire.
