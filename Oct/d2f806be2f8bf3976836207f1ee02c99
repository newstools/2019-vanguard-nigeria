A man who died a year ago was mistakenly reappointed to serve on the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB), the government says. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1274290 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dead.png?resize=490%2C340&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dead man reappointed to serve country's film board in Kenya" width="490" height="340" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dead.png?w=490&amp;ssl=1 490w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dead.png?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dead.png?resize=58%2C40&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dead.png?resize=260%2C180&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dead.png?resize=187%2C130&amp;ssl=1 187w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Robert Kochalle died in May last year but was among three people reappointed to the KFCB, which regulates cinema and broadcast content.
