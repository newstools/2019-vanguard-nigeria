According to him, even people who may have ambition are aware that this is not the time. “At this point in time all hands must be on deck to support President Muhammadu Buhari and all our state governors in their respective states to work together unanimously to deliver deliverables for the good of our people in the states and at the Federal level.” Oshiomhole said that politics could not be an all round season, saying that the season for politics was over. According to him, the judiciary is clearing the governorship, the National Assembly and even the presidential elections. “Once these are done and put behind us, I expect all Nigerians to insist that those elected should go back to work and deliver and justify the mandate they have been given.
