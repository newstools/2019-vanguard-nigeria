Electronics manufacture, LG, is bringing voice recognition to customers via its ThinQ mobile app. The app which LG describes as the first mobile application for smart home appliance management, gives users convenience to connect to their appliances from anywhere. It leverages the Google Assistant’s voice recognition technology to manage all Wi-Fi enabled appliances including washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, air purifiers among others. According to LG, users will enjoy the incredible ease of controlling and monitoring their appliances via conversational voice commands as the app provides real-time status updates for all connected LG devices with just one command. It explain that users can verbally ask the ThinQ app to check the time remaining on the washing machine cycle from the office or adjust the temperature of the air conditioner while driving home without having to stop what they’re doing to look at their phones.
