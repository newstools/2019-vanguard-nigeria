Speaking after the inauguration, the new presiden said the association would work towards ensuring a new drive for sports writers to get their proper place in the development of sports in the country. “The new leadership will carry out this association’s activities in line with the constitution of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) and the SWAN statutes. “That is where we are, and we will not trample upon the rights of members. “We will respect everybody and give the association a better face,” he said. “There are several measures that we will need to take to instill discipline. But that is the first step,” he said. The SWAN president further said the association would vigorously pursue interests that would be of larger benefit to its members, just as he pledged to operate an open door policy. He charged members to be steadfast as they go along with the new thinking of the leadership. Aigbona said that the registration fee for members would now be N1,500 for three years. He urged all aggrieved members over the past three years to return to the fold as the new leadership would want the association to remain as a family. Vanguard News Nigeria.
