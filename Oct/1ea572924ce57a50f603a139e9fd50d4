Tyson Fury will be back in the ring this month, but rather than it being the latest step in his bid for heavyweight supremacy, it will be to settle a score with WWE superstar Braun Strowman. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1270427" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C574&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=200%2C112&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?resize=560%2C314&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1270426" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=300%2C168&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=1024%2C574&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=200%2C112&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?resize=560%2C314&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/988967-01-06.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Fury will face Strowman at pay-per-view event, Crown Jewel, WWE confirmed on Friday. Lineal heavyweight champion Fury jumped out of the crowd during a Strowman match on Smackdown last week. He was then given an ‘open mic’ on Monday night Raw and was involved in a brawl with Strowman before multiple wrestlers intervened to keep them apart. Their feud will be settled on October 31 in Saudi Arabia, where Brock Lesnar will meet former MMA foe Cain Velasquez, who defeated him for the UFC heavyweight title at UFC 121 in 2010. Velasquez has retired from MMA and signed a multi-year deal with WWE. Fury has said previously he could be interested in a move to WWE, telling the Dave Allen podcast in 2017 he would consider it. Speaking after the announcement of the fight, Fury said: “It’s something I’ve always dreamed of, lifelong WWE fan, it’s a fantastic opportunity for me to be here. I just want to say how excited I am to be fighting the monster among men Braun Strowman. After seeing him I really know why he’s got the nickname the monster among men. “But me being the undefeated lineal heavyweight boxing champion, I fear no man. I’m undefeated in 30 professional contests, and when I go Saudi Arabia to fight Braun Strowman I’m still going to be undefeated, because I’m going to knock Braun Strowman out. He talks about how good his hands are, but he’s messing with a guy whose got the best hands in boxing. He doesn’t want none of them hands, let me tell you that.” He holds a 29-0-1 record in professional boxing and is reportedly set to face WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in a rematch in February, the pair having battled to a thrilling draw last December.
