According to him, the attackers were from Niger state. “Following the good relationship and understanding established with the bandits which led to their repentance in Zamfara, I can assure you that those attackers are not from Zamfara. “Immediately after the attack, we reached out to the Fulani leaders in the state who confirmed to us that none of their members participated, but we have summoned a meeting with them to forestal reoccurrence,” he said. Some eyewitnesses who spoke to NAN on condition of anonymity said the bandits that attacked the joint security outpost numbered over 200, riding motorcycles.
