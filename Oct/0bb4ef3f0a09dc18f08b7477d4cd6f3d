Emotan who described herself as a versatile singer, said her music preaches freedom, a message of hope that someday things will get better. “I enjoy writing songs. I could write any kind of music. It’s a mixture of Jazz, Reggae, R&B, and other genre. I am versatile and that’s my style. I try to make my music universal. I do whatever I could do to pass my message and entertain my fans. I love my songs preaching freedom, a message of hope that someday things will go better.

From the few tracks I have done, I think people have been able to relate to my music, I know hopefully I will have a very good reception. Music has always been my dream and my passion. I’m also a song writer. I have been writing songs since my young age. I have written over 200 songs,” she said. With the current trend of musicians crossing the line to Nollywood, Emotan Shine says music remains her first love. “Well, I think when you are a musician, you are naturally half acting because music is about expression and performance. So I can never say no to it if it comes my way. Although, I don’t have any plans towards that for now. My hands are full. I have too much programs already. But I can’t say never, so when Nollywood comes, I might just go for it,” she says.
