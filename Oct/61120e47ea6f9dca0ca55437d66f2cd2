On average, this is done every five years in line with Global best practice. The corporation increased the maximum deposit insurance coverage twice, from ¦ 50,000 per depositor per deposit money bank (DMB) at inception, to  N200,000 in 2006 and  N500,000    in 2010. “Similarly, maximum coverage per depositor of PMBs/MFBs was increased from  N100,000    in 2006 to  N200,000    in 2010. Coverage per depositor per PMB had since been increased to  N500,000    to reflect the increased deposits structure in the sub-sector and to stimulate Mortgage Savings. “To date, the NDIC has paid a cumulative sum of over  ¦ 8.25 billion as insured amount to 442,999 depositors of closed DMBs;  paid over  ¦ 2.97 billion to 83,415 depositors of closed MFBs,  and over  ¦ 70.53 million was paid to 869 depositors of closed PMBs.” Highlighting the impact of the bridge bank initiative in resolution of the failure of  Afribank, Spring Bank and BankPHB in 2011 and Skye Bank in 2018, Ibrahim said: “The bridge bank initiative safeguarded 12,667 jobs, protected deposit liabilities of over ¦ 1.759 trillion which ensured that depositors had uninterrupted access to their funds, and prevented the systemic repercussions of the failure of the bank on the entire financial system. The Bridge bank option engendered macro-economic stability, sustained daily operations of the failed banks including meeting maturing obligations and enhanced the confidence of Depositors and other Stakeholders.” THE appearance of Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) at the public hearing organised by the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions to defend its quest for amendments of its 2006 Act last March has ignited a debate on the pros and cons of the proposed amendment.
