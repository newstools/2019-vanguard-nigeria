Mr Kelvin thanked the various MDAs for their diligence and input in the certification process, urging all stakeholders to continue to support the ESIPO to actualize the dreams of the Godwin Obaseki-led administration. According to him: “I wish to thank you all for your time. I also acknowledge and appreciate the support from the Honorable Commissioners and Permanent Secretaries of the various MDAs. We are all committed to this course. We must change the narrative.” The certification process commenced nine months ago with the visitation of the Executive Secretary, Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Yewande Sadiku. The final stage is the review meeting, which has revealed a lot of progress made so far by the state.
