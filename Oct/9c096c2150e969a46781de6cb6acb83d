He stressed the need for stakeholders to develop the agricultural value chain in order to achieve economic growth. “Organisations and associations in the sector should adopt the value chain in order to meet the country’s much-needed quality products, export opportunities and food security,” he said. He said that the Federal Government was also determined to establishing a sustainable agricultural sector that would raise the incomes of the rural population and reinforce the nation’s economy. The minister pledged the Federal Government’s readiness to support the Bauchi State government to modernise its grazing reserves in line with international best practice. He said that the livestock transformation plan, initiated by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was to cater to the needs of the citizens. Nanono said that his ministry would sensitise farmers and other critical stakeholders on the need to key into the policy, stressing that some foreign investors had agreed to invest in the sector. While assuring of the Federal Government’s support for effective implementation of the policy in the state, the minister attributed the high rate of unemployment in the country to the collapse of industries. ⤕$50bn Africa Food Import: Obasanjo urges DRC to invest in agriculture ⤕Gov Emmanuel to increase investment in Agriculture “Modern approaches to cattle rearing will create more value-added products such as milk, beef and leather, all of which can either be used locally or exported,” he said.
