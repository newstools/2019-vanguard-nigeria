Things didn’t quite work out for the Brazilian at the Nou Camp and he now finds himself on loan at Bayern Munich. However, Spanish outlet AS have reported Barcelona’s annual accounts which show how much the club owes others within football, and it’s Liverpool which stands out, according to DailyMail report. From the original Coutinho fee, it’s stated £84m is still to be paid. There is also no suggestion that this outstanding debt is related to bonuses. £24m of that amount is considered to be due in the ‘short term’, although the accounts provide no precise time-frame. The new information will be of concern to Barca fans, the club owing £232m to clubs in total. In turn, they are owed £67m, £22m of which Everton are responsible for, according to MailOnline report. <img class="size-medium wp-image-1268294 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.png?resize=300%2C292&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="292" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.png?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.png?resize=58%2C56&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.png?resize=199%2C194&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.png?resize=133%2C130&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.png?w=307&amp;ssl=1 307w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Coutinho made contributed 21 goals and 11 assists in 76 appearances for Barcelona but never quite managed to win over the club’s supporters.
