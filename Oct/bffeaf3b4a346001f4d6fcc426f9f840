I have not experienced this kind of fear since I packed into this area more than 15 years,” he said. NAN reports that residents of the area went indoors earlier than usual to avoid the consequences of an encounter with a loose lion. As at the time of filing this report armed policemen have been deployed to the area while a search team was trying to capture the lion. All effort to contact the Managing Director of the Zoological Garden, Alhaji Saidu Gwadabe failed as his telephone line was not going through.  The authorities of the University of Ibadan have denied the rumour that two lions have escaped from their cages at the zoological gardens in the institution and are said to be on rampage.
