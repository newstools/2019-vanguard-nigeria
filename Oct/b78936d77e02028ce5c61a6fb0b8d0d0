ABUJA- THE Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, yesterday commended the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige  for taking  firm patriotic measures   to stem the tide of  unfair labour practices in the Oil and Gas sector during the first term of the Buhari administration. The union who paid the tribute in a congratulatory message to the Minister on his re-appointment,  extolled what it termed  “ bold and laudable efforts to put to an end,  the near enslavement of Nigerians in the employ of the oil companies .” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1205531 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NUPENG.jpg?resize=288%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="NUPENG,Ngige" width="288" height="162" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NUPENG.jpg?w=288&amp;ssl=1 288w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NUPENG.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NUPENG.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NUPENG.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> According to the letter signed by its President, Comrade Williams Akporeha,  “NUNPENG still remembers with joy and sincere appreciation, your bold and laudable efforts in stemming the gale of redundancies and retrenchments in the  Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry most especially at the earlier part of the first tenure of the administration when crude oil prices went down and Oil Companies were making attempts to make Nigerian  workers pay for the downturn,.” DESOPADEC strategizes for effective delivery(Opens in a new browser tab) The union further noted that the few disagreements it had with the Minister during his first term was on principles and were not strange in tripartite relations, adding that lessons have been mutually learnt. It therefore promised to “offer  hands of fellowship and support to you in making your second term in this highly esteemed and honourable office rewarding, successful and positively impactful to the nation at large.” President Muhammedu Buhari and Governor Senator Ifeanyi Okowa  have assured labour leaders of freedom of association urging them to embrace dialogue rather than confrontation in resolving industrial disputes.
