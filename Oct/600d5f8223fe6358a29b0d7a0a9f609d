The strength of this partnership is to see how we can technically work together to meet the orthopaedic needs of Nigerian consumers” he stressed. National President of NAOMT, Dr.Onigbinde Ayodele, said the endorsement of Mouka is an offshoot of a detailed assessment of the brand’s orthopaedic mattresses. “Mouka has improved the foam materials to orthopaedic standards that will meet the needs of the community of people using the mattresses. They have made a lot of improvement on the orthopaedic mattresses that you cannot compare them with other mattresses. There’s a wide difference between Mouka and other mattresses.” Onigbinde said before they endorsement, they inspected the production process and seen that it meets best practices.
