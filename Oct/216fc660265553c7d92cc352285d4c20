Prof. Bazuaye also appealed to the government; the First Ladies in the country to sponsor stem cell transplanting, genotype screening saying that that it was cheaper to carry out the transplant in Nigeria, insisting that while it would cost about N3million to carry out a cell transplant in Nigeria, it will cost about N70million in Europe to perform the same operation. He also advised the Nigerian government to build an international Stem Cell Transplant Centre in the country to save millions of Nigeria by those going abroad for what Nigerian Medical practitioners could do and discourage medical tourism. vanguard ...As Hope rises for sickle cell patients Dr. Godwin Bazuaye is a consultant dermatologist and specialist in bone marrow transplants.
