At a conference in Berlin, the authorities claimed progress in combating clans in the capital had been made following stricter measures introduced a year ago. The clans, largely Arab in origin, were feeling the effects, Berlin police president Barbara Slowik said. “We must not – and this is the danger – let up on the pressure,” she said. The Berlin senator for interior affairs, Andreas Geisel, and the Europol head for organised crime, Jari Matti Liukku, emphasised the significance of national and international cooperation. “If we succeed in working across Germany and across national borders, we have come a big step further,” Geisel said. Since the beginning of the year, Berlin police have acted on 237 occasions against clans, often in cooperation with customs, the tax authorities and job centres.
