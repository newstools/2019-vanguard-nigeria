Also responding to high import duties for medical equipments, she said: “We need to look at the duties on medical equipment, and see how we can bring which ever taxes or duties down to zero and that would make people to be able to bring more medical equipment in Nigeria. “Also, I do feel that the medical equipment available globally is actually a bit too expensive for what people can afford. For example, the ventilator that we use,is $50, 000. Now what fees are you going to charge a patient to use that machine. “So what is happening in India is that they have been designing their own equipment that is far cheaper and because of that, that’s part of the reasons why health care is so cheap in India. “So that requires investment in education and research so that we can start designing our own equipment that is far cheaper than what is available else where. Meanwhile, Flying Doctors Nigeria is a company into the business of moving patients from areas where the health care is not so good to better areas of help care. Giving her opinion on emergency medicine, Brown said emergency medicine is such an important component of  health care because it ensures that people can get to the right medical facility that can take care of them within the right time frame, thereby preventing deaths and disability for young and active members of the population. ...calls for mandatory NHIS for all Nigerians By Chioma Obinna & Chinelo Azike The Executive Secretary, National Health Insurance Scheme, NHIS, Prof. Mohammed Sambo, has called for the involvement of the States in health insurance schemes to enable speedy achievement of the Universal Health Coverage, UHC, in Nigeria.
