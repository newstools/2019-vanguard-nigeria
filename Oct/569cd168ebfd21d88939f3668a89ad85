Elumelu said the group was used to turning around businesses, creating value and improving lives. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for being an appreciative government that recognised what the firm was doing in the private sector. “The development of our country must be led by the private and public sector working together. “ So, the private and public sectors must work together to move this country forward. “ We are grateful to the Federal Government, we are grateful to the NCP for this, that’s why we are here to see the vice president.’’ On the business environment in Nigeria, Elumelu said that the ease of doing business was improving in the country. He said that the presidential team that was driving the ease of doing business was doing a great job as Nigeria had moved to a higher ranking.
