The report also attributed the 3,133.9 megawatts not generated to high frequency. It also noted that 40 megawatts of electricity were not generated due to the unavailability of transmission infrastructure during the period. Similarly, it said that 1,674 megawatts were not generated due to unavailability of gas. The report revealed that the power sector lost an estimated over N2.32 billion on Thursday due to insufficient gas supply, distribution and transmission infrastructure.
