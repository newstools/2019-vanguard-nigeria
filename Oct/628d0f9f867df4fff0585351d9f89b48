Ayo said that lecturers and faculty members are supposed to act as parents to the students. The former vice chancellor said that being in a position of authority does not confer on lecturers the right to oppress or molest students for sex. He said that sex for marks was one of the factors responsible for the falling standard of educational system in the country.
