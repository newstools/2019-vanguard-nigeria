I have the assurance of the Minister of Aviation that the work will be done speedily and to the highest standards. “Even as we have many items competing for our limited resources, we will continue to prioritize infrastructure investments in every part of the country. It is our responsibility to ensure Nigeria’s infrastructure is fixed. we will keep doing this,” Buhari stated after the meeting. The South-East governors and leaders from the zone on Thursday demanded for a special fund for the rehabilitation of the Akanu Ibiam Airport in Enugu State. They made the demand during the meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Speaking on behalf of the group, Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum and Ebonyi Governor, Dave Umahi, also sought for declaration of state of emergency on roads and erosion in the South East.  He said: ”We are here to kindly urge Mr. President to approve special fund for the Akanu Ibiam Airport just like what was done for Abuja Airport.” According to him, the closure of the Enugu airport has grounded activities in the region and causing great hardship on the people. The deplorable South East roads, he said, have made the lives of the people miserable. The meeting went into closed doors as journalists were asked to leave the Council Chamber before the President started his speech.
