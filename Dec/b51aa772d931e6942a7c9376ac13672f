Ferrari has previously said a fully electric vehicle would be launched after the current industrial plan ends in 2022. Analysts have said they do not expect it before 2023. Camilleri said Ferrari was “certainly” studying a fully electric grand tourer car (GT), but that it would stick to hybrid vehicles for the “current foreseeable future”. “My sense is the electric will come out after 2025.

So eventually we will come out with one. But it’s post-2025. Not in the short term,” he added.
