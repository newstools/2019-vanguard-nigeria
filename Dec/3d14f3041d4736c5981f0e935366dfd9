The fraud was only recently discovered as a result of President Buhari’s anti-corruption efforts spearheaded by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.” The AGF further disclosed that the federal government argued in the new suit that the Gas Supply and Processing Agreement (GSPA) was procured on the basis of fraud and corruption, while the subsequent arbitral process was riddled with irregularities and deliberately concealed from the rest of the government. “The filing is a significant step forward in the federal government fight to secure justice for the people of Nigeria. The federal government has recently expanded its legal team to include leading London law firm Mishcon de Reya. The team is led by Shaistah Akhtar, Partner, and Mark Howard QC of Brick Court Chambers. “The expansion will enable the federal government to launch in full its investigations and challenges. “It is important to note that clear and concrete evidence of fraud and corruption were only recently discovered. This followed an increase in the Buhari government’s well-regarded anti-corruption efforts. “The new administration’s efforts have brought to light the fraudulent nature of the P&ID contract. President Buhari has established several initiatives aimed at tackling corruption. This includes the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption and the Whistle-Blowers Policy in 2016, as well as the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS) 2017-2021, in 2017,” it added.
