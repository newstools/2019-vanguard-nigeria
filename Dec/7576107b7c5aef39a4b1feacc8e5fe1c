It was the first Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) match in Ilorin since the 2017/18 season when Kwara United were relegated from the top flight and marks their return after the buy-over of Delta Force received conditional approval by the League Management Company (LMC). Heartland moved to within three points of the top four with the victory, while Kwara United remain rooted in the relegation zone after the loss. The penalty was awarded on the 60th minute after a Kwara United defender handled the ball in the 18-yard box. Kwara United’s best chance in the game came after Pyagbara’s goal, with Afolabi Abdulwaheed and Emmanuel Godwin failing to beat goalkeeper Chijioke Ejiogu after being presented with good chances.
