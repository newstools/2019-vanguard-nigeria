 At the just held MTN MUSON Donors appreciation concert, the power and beauty of music came alive. The fusion of different musical instruments, the sweet pitch and tone from the sonorous singers created a serene mood at the Agip Recital Hall, MUSON Centre. It was like a kaleidoscope of beautiful moments and highly pleasing to the ears. The students of the MUSON who are on a scholarship from the MTN Foundation entertained guests with remarkable musical renditions of classics. More amazing was the performance of Phyno’s Fada Fada and some songs in the Fuji genre using a mixture of classical and traditional instruments.
