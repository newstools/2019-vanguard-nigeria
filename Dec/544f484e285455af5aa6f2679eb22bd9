YouTube said it has always banned content that explicitly threatens someone or that encourages people to harass someone else, but will now add implicit threats and demeaning language to the criteria.

The change follows months of debate spurred by videos posted by conservative comedian and host Steven Crowder citing Latino journalist Carlos Maza’s sexual orientation and ethnic background. Maza, who identifies as gay, spoke out in May about repeated harassment he said he experienced from Crowder. YouTube initially said Crowder’s comments did not violate its policies, but the platform deemed them “hurtful.” It later decided to suspend Crowder’s ability to earn ad revenue.
