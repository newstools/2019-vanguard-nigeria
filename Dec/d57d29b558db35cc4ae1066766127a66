The NDLEA commander said: “The suspect was arrested by the command last year along Kontagora with 64kg of Indian Hemp and was convicted by a court and served a one-year jail term. ”The command will, however, not relent in curbing the activities of drug peddlers in the state and the nation at large.” She appealed to members of the public to always report any suspicious activity of drug peddlers to relevant authorities, to rid the state of drug trafficking and its attendant crises. “We have since reached out to traditional and religious leaders to mobilize residents to give relevant information on those with illegal business in their midst,” she added.
