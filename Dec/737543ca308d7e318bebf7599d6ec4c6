The successful beneficiaries participated in an intensive business training  administered online and in select communities in each country during the programme. The selected young African entrepreneurs  will join the alumni network of the Tony Elumelu Foundation’s flagship Entrepreneurship Programme and will each receive seed funding between $1,500 and $5,000, depending on the size of their business initiative. The TEF-UNDP Entrepreneurship Programme is a partnership between the  Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) and the  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to empower 100,000 entrepreneurs over 10 years across Africa. The selection process of the TEF-UNDP Entrepreneurship Programme, which commenced with a call for applications in July 2019, ended with a pitching competition in various communities in the seven countries, powered by the United Bank for Africa Plc, while the selection process was coordinated by the global accounting firm, Deloitte.
