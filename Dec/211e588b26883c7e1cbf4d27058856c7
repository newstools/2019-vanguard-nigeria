Financial Vanguard analysis showed that the naira has been on the downward trend in the I&E window since November 15th when it closed at N362.58 per dollar. Since then, the naira has depreciated by N1.99 kobo against the dollar in the I&E window. Also, the naira has been on the downward trend in the parallel market since November 21st when it closed at N358 per dollar. Since then the naira has depreciated by N2.5 against the dollar in the parallel market. The depreciation is driven by increased demand for dollars due to rising concerns over the six-month decline of the nation’s external reserves. While the downward trend in the external reserves is driven by lower revenue from oil, which accounts for about 90 per cent of the nation’s dollar earnings, it is aggravated by increased dollar sales by the CBN in its bid to meet dollar demand by foreign investors exiting the nation’s fixed income market. The declining trend persisted last week with the reserves closing at $38.775 billion on Tuesday, December 24th, representing a week-on-week decline of $250 million when compared with $39.035 billion on Tuesday, December 17th.
