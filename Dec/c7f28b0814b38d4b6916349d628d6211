Recall that Sanwo-Olu had declared zero-tolerance against all traffic violators in the state and directed relevant authorities to enforce 2012 Lagos Traffic Laws to the latter. The “Okoda” riders and the impounded motorcycles were subsequently, handed over to the state Taskforce on Environmental and Special Enforcement Unit, for prosecution.
