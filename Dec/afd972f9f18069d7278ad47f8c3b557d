Frivolous items in FG 2020 budget The federal government budget is replete with  items which monitoring would literally be impossible, an indication that a lot of items would be impossible to track, especially by the media, Civil Society Organisations and, indeed, the public.

Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday signed the 2020 Appropriation Bill of N10.594 trillion into law. The signing ceremony witnessed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, President of the Senate, Dr.Ahmad Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, the Minister of State, Budget and others, took place at the President’s office, Presidential Villa, Abuja. This is even as the Senate president, Ahmad Lawan, said the federal government would depend on borrowing and Production Sharing Contract, PSC, to finance the 2020 budget. In his speech at the ceremony, President Buhari commended the leadership of the National Assembly for passing the budget before year end, saying that he planed to send a borrowing plan bill for passage by the parliament. The 2020 Budget passed by the National Assembly provides for aggregate expenditures of N10.594 trillion, an increase of  N263.95 billion  over what the executive proposed when it was submitted in October 2019. President Buhari said he has examined the adjustments and might revert to the National Assembly with a request for virement or other relevant amendments. The President said:  “I am very pleased that the National Assembly worked uncommonly long hours in the interest of our people and the national economy to ensure detailed legislative review and passage of the budget within two months. “This patriotic zeal adopted by the Ninth National Assembly has restored our budget cycle to a predictable January to December fiscal year.  Furthermore, in the twenty years since the return to civilian democracy, this will be just the fourth time that the federal budget was passed before the end of the previous year, and this is the earliest. “The passage of the Finance Bill, which I am told will be done in the coming days, will also be a landmark achievement worthy of recognition, being the first time this has been done in the last twenty years. “We look forward to receiving this bill shortly for Presidential assent. Once passed into law, the Finance Bill will support funding and implementation of the 2020 Budget. We shall sustain this tradition by ensuring that subsequent budgets are also accompanied by a Finance Bill.” He thanked the Ninth National Assembly for supporting important legislation, such as the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Amendment Act and the 2019 Finance Bill. According to him, these laws are vital to the successful implementation of the 2020 Budget. “I am aware of the regular high-level discussions that took place, between senior officials of the Executive and the Legislature during this period. I commend this renewed partnership, the mutual understanding as well as collaboration between these two arms of government. “Now, we are well positioned to effectively implement the budget and deliver our promises to Nigerians. Businesses will also benefit as they are now in a position to plan more effectively. We have to sustain this harmonious working relationship. I expect that, going forward, this will be the norm. “I have directed that efforts be made to ensure the presentation of the 2021 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly in September 2020. I am confident that all Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies will cooperate with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning to keep to this timeline. “I will work with the Ninth National Assembly to give effect to the constitutional, legislative and other actions that may be necessary to address the various challenges currently associated with our federal budgeting process, including the enactment of an Organic Budget Bill.” Vanguard President Muhammadu Buhari is to spend N1. 001 billion on travels this year.
