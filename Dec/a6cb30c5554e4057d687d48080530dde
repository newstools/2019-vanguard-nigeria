This is also in line with the budget thrust of Government which is focused on growing development and sustainable growth.” Vanguard A joint public hearing of the Senate and House of Representatives committees on Appropriation on the 2020 Appropriation Bill, 2020 Budget is underway at the Senate Hearing Room in the National Assembly.
