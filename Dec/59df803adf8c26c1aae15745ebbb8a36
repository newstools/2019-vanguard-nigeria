Oyebode said this while speaking as a guest lecturer at the 44th Convocation Ceremony of the Obafemi Awolowo University,  Ile-Ife,  on Wednesday. His lecture was entitled: “Education: The Key to Unlocking Nigeria’s Human Capital.” According to Oyebode, education is the panacea to transforming society,  ending poverty,  fostering peace, eradicating diseases and reducing climate change. He said the success of the country depended on the progress in education, adding that   “meeting our collective aspirations as a nation will require a complete overhaul in education.” Oyebode said learning outcomes from the country’s education system were low and far from what was required for Nigeria to achieve its productive potential as the giant of Africa. According to him, without qualitative education, children are faced with the prospects of becoming disenfranchised, radicalised and lured into illegal activity which would have adverse socio-economic consequences. He said that the current structure of education had failed Nigerian children, noting that “even after 16 years of education, many Nigerian youths are unemployable.” Vanguard Two years after its activities were summarily put on hold, the Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Section of Business Law, SBL rejuvenates with its upcoming Annual SBL conference scheduled for June 17-20, 2012, where it aimed at exploring available resources to improve the lots of Nigerian Lawyers on commercial law practice… May 10, 2012 In "Law & Human Rights" Prof Akin Oyebode and some other African activists on Monday lauded the contributions of the late Afro-beat musician Fela Anikulapo Kuti to societal transformation.
