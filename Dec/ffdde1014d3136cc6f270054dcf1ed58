Espanyol have just 10 points from 18 games and fired coach Pablo Machin and three of his staff on Monday after the weekend 2-0 defeat to second-bottom Leganes. Machin took over in October when previous incumbent David Gallego was sacked after eight games and just one win in early October. The new coach Fernandez, 49, is a former Barcelona and Spain defender and left Liga outfit Alaves after finishing 14th at the end of last season.
