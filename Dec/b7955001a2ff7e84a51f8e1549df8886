While saying that the fasting would hold on Jan. 2, 2020, he enjoined the entire kingdom to also support the efforts of the royal fathers, “as prayers are never too much and nobody knows whose prayers the Almighty will accept,” vanguard ....Deputy Chief Whip sues for peace By Ozioruva Aliu, Benin-City As the crisis between the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole  and Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki continues unabated, the Edo Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs has decided to observe a day's fasting for… December 30, 2019 In "News" President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday met behind closed doors with Edo State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
