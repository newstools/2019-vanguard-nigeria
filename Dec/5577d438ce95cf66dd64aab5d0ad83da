Former governors  are bearing an exerting pressure on national development with pension payments and other entitlements draining billions of naira every year from development funds for the states. Over N37.367 billion was according to Vanguard findings expended on servicing  47 former governors from 21 of the nation’s states in pension payments and provision of houses, staff and motor vehicles replaceable between three and four years. Payment of pension to former governors over a four year cycle are highest in Bauchi, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, and Lagos States with former governors drawing N23.18 billion N2.795 billion, N2.043 billion and N1.606 billion respectively over four years. The payments are in many cases besides provisions for medical expenses for the former chief executives which run into hundreds of millions per former chief executive in many cases. Pension payment  and other entitlements The pension payments and other entitlements drawn by the governors are irrespective of the prescription of the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, RMAFC providing 300 percent severance for the governors as stated in the Certain Political Office Holders and Judicial Officers Remuneration Act. Under that act, former governors are like lawmakers entitled to 300% of their basic salary of N2, 223,705 amounting to N6,671,115 as severance pay. Most of the provisions stipulate the provision of vehicles renewable every three to four years, accommodation at the state capital and sometimes in Abuja, 30 days paid for holiday outside the country and free medical treatment for the former governors and their immediate family members. However, a few other states including Akwa Ibom, Yobe, Gombe Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Kwara and Sokoto States have forked up outlandish cash transfers to the former governors. The humongous payouts are sometimes styled as medical allowance and have been the butt of much controversies. Sokoto The Sokoto State pension law provides for N200 million every four years for former governors, and with three former governors, the state would have to cough out N600 million every four years to transfer to the former governors. Another N180 million is set out for payment to former deputy governors. Gombe Gombe was the first to pay out a benefit in the hundreds of millions when it paid N900 million to its two living former governors (Abubakar Hashidu and Senator Danjuma Goje) under the state pension law for former governors which provides N300 million per term for each of the two governors. Yobe The version of the Yobe State pension law, signed into law in early 2007 by former governor, Bukar Abba Ibrahim gives former governors pension for life. The former governor/ deputy receive 200 million and 150 million respectively, two vehicles replaceable every four years, two drivers, free medical for the former governors/ deputies and their immediate families in Nigeria or abroad. Senator Abba Ibrahim who served three different times as governor of the state is the only one enjoying the entitlement being the only former governor alive. The only other person to have shared the governor’s office with him are the late Senator Mamman Ali who died in office and the incumbent. Besides the homogonous cash payments, some states including Cross River, Kwara, Lagos, Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Ebonyi, Kano, Zamfara and Sokoto states have also recommended the payment of the basic salaries of the incumbent governors as yearly pension payments to their former governors. Kwara The version of the governors’ pension law in Kwara State which came into effect in 2010 states the former governor shall be entitled to two cars and a security car, replaceable every three years, a well-furnished 5-bedroom duplex, furniture allowance of 300 per cent of his salary; five personal staff, three SSS, free medical care for the governor and the deputy, 30 percent of salary for car maintenance, 20 per cent for utility, 10 percent for entertainment, 10 per cent for house maintenance. Emeka Wogu and RMAF Chief Emeka Wogu, a former minister who also represented Abia State in the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, RMAFC and was chairman of the RMAFC committee which prescribed the severance payments told Vanguard that the pension laws prescribed by the states if inconsistent with the law as prescribed by the commission would be deemed illegal. Wogu, also a lawyer and public policy expert, however, drew back from declaring the payments to the former governors as illegal. “Anything outside the law that was recommended by the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, which is Certain political office holders and judicial officers remuneration act is not in consonance of the law and where it is already prescribed by state Houses of Assembly that means that such laws is in conflict with the federal law.” Ahead of the 2015 presidential election, General Muhammadu Buhari as candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC had promised to use moral suasion to compel the governors to amend the provisions of the pension law on the ground that they were unsustainable. His efforts since he came to power have, however, yet to come to public knowledge. Akwa Ibom Akwa Ibom under the Pension Act, 2014 spends an average of 174.16 on former governors a year and N93.62 million on each former deputy governor per year. That is besides the estimated N25 million spent every four years in changing the official and utility cars of each former governor and deputy governor. Besides, it is believed that not less than N300 million provided for the building of a mansion in the state or Abuja for former governors. Official and  utility cars Akwa Ibom with two former governors, and two former deputy governors who qualify for the pension scheme, the state is expected to spend N2.043 billion over a four year round . Rivers Rivers State will spend an estimated N2.795 billion maintaining its four former governors under provisions of the Rivers State Pensions for Governor and Deputy Governor Law, 2012. The state will spend an average of N38.8 million in pension payments to the four former governors of the state annually at the rate of N9.7 million each.   Over four years, it would amount to N155.2 million. However, the government is expected to spend a minimum of N240 million replacing the three vehicles provided for each of the former governors every three years . Even more, the state government is expected to provide free medical services and provide two choice houses in Rivers State and Abuja for each of the former governors under the pension law passed during the tenure of Former Governor Chibuke Amaechi. With property cost averaging N300 million in Port-Harcourt and Abuja, the government would have forked out at least N2.4 billion providing the houses for the former governors. The former governors of Rivers State are Rotimi Amaechi, Celestine Omehia, Peter Odili and Rufus Ada George. The pension law for former governors which came into effect under the administration of Governor Amaechi provides among others that the former governors would enjoy 100 per cent of their basic salaries, two choice houses in any area of their choice in Rivers State and Abuja, three cars, replaceable every three years. 300 per cent of annual basic salary as funding for any furniture of their choice. The law also provides that 20 per cent, 10 per cent and 10 per cent of the annual salary of the incumbent governor should be earmarked for utility, accommodation maintenance and entertainment respectively. Lagos The Lagos State Governor and Deputy Governor Pensions Law of 2007 provides that former governors and deputy governors who are not impeached should receive 100% of the salary of the incumbent governor as pension and former governors who serve out two terms will be entitled to two houses; one in Abuja and another in Lagos. Annual  salary Those who served one term will be entitled to one house in Lagos while former deputy governors would also be entitled to one house in Lagos. Officially, a sum of N7.595 million under the law is due to each of the three former governors of the state, Tinubu, Tunde Fashola and Lateef Jakande based on calculations drawn from the annual salary of N2.22 million due the current governor. Over a four year period, the money comes to N91.14 million. The entitlements include furniture allowance of 300% every two years, House maintenance (10%) P. A. (0.25%), Car maintenance (30%) entertainment (10%) and Utility (20%). Besides, the state government is expected to provide six and five new vehicles for the former governor and deputy governor and provide unlimited medical coverage for the former governor and members of his immediate family. With a standard vehicle of the status of the former governors going for nothing less than N20 million each and a utility vehicle going for N5 million, that could come to N105 million for the six vehicles for each former governor. For all three former governors the amount comes to N315 million within which period the cars are to be replaced. For the two deputy governors covered by the law who are each entitled to four cars and a pilot vehicle each, it comes to N170 million. Besides, the former governor and former deputy are to enjoy domestic staff including drivers and security at the expense of the state government. With at least seven domestic staff for the former governor and five for the former deputy governor, Former governors of Lagos State who served out two terms are also entitled to a building in Abuja and one in Lagos. At a conservative figure of N300 million each, building the houses for the two former governors of Lagos State would further cost N1.2 billion bringing the total expenditure on former governors of Lagos to an estimated N1.606 billion besides the expenses on domestic staff, security personnel among others. Abia Two former governors of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu and Senator Theodore Orji are beneficiaries of the Abia State Governors’/Deputy Governors’ Pension Law. The former governors are entitled to 100% of the salary of the incumbent which for the two men would mean sharing N4.44 million every year and N17.76 million over four years. The official vehicle earmarked at N20 million each could bring the expenditure on the two former governors of the state over four years to N57.76 million Former deputy governors of the state are also entitled to 100 per cent of the salary of the incumbent deputy governor. Besides the pension , the Pension Law for former governors and deputy governors of the state also provides that former governors are entitled to “the sum of money as may from time to time be granted by the State Government by way of Pensions, allowances and privileges in accordance with this Law”. Privileges for  the former governor The privileges for the former governor include an official car, a police orderly, two operatives of Department of State Service, two police men for the security of his house. He is also entitled to allowances for cooks, stewards, driver and gardener. On a conservative monthly payment of N30,000 for each, that could bring the total  payment on domestic staff to   the two former governors over four years to N11.52 million bringing the total expenditure on the two former governors of the state to N69.28 million over four years The Law also made provision for medical attention for the former governors and their deputies. Some privileges are also extended to former deputy governors but lower than what the former governor enjoy. The former deputy governors of Abia State entitled to the allowance are Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Chief Eric Acho Nwakanma, who served under Orji Uzor Kalu. Chief Emeka Ananaba who served with former Governor Orji. Senator Abaribe, however, told Vanguard that he was not collecting any pension from the Abia State government. Osun In Osun State, the law guiding the payment of pensions to former governors and their deputies is cited as the Pension (Governor and Deputy Governor) Law 2001. The law stipulates that former governors and former deputy governors shall be entitled to pension at the rate equivalent to the incumbent office holder. That would entail N2.22 million to the three former governors of the state; namely, Senator Isiaka Adeleke, Bisi Akande and Prince Olagunose Oyinola. Over four years, the three would have collected N26.64 million. Edo Benefits accruable to former governors of Edo State under the Pension Rights of the Governor and Deputy Governor Law 2007 presently amount to 100 per cent of the salary of the incumbent governor for life, an officer not above Salary grade level 12 as Special Assistant, a personal secretary not below grade level 10 who shall be selected by the former governor from the public service of Edo State. Edo State arguably has the highest number of living former civilian governors with Dr. S. O. Ogbemudia, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, Chief Lucky Igbinedion, Prof. Oserheimen Osunbor and lately, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. The amount accruable to them presently stands at N11 million per year and N44 million over four years. The SA and personal secretary earning on the average of N300,000 and N100,000 monthly respectively, makes it that the state would expend N24 million on the aides of the five former governors amounting to N96 million over four years. That would bring the total expenditure on the former governors to N140 million over four years. However, should Governor Godwin Obaseki sign the new pension bill for former governors of Edo State, passed by the House of Assembly last November it would significantly raise the amount being expended on former governors of the state who outnumber former governors elsewhere. That could mean the state providing N200 million each for building a house for each of the former five governors bringing the total expenditure to be expended over four years to N1.14 billion for the former governors alone. Gombe The pension for former governors of Gombe State is guided by the Establishment of Executive Pension Law and other Matters Connected therewith, 2008. The law stipulates that a former governor shall be provided with a Personal Assistant not less than GL 10, two vehicles, to be replaced every four years, two drivers, free medical treatment for the former governor and his immediate family within Nigeria or abroad, 30 days annual vacation outside Nigeria with 30 days estacode with travel expense allowance for himself and wife, a furnished befitting accommodation in any part of the state, one direct telephone line internet facilities. The former governor also goes with N200 million as severance allowance while deputy governors go with N100 milion. With a 30 day vacation for the governor and a wife not costing less than an estimated N10 million, two vehicles at N20 million each, a personal assistant earning N300,000 monthly, two drivers earning N30,000 each Gombe State could spend N54.3 million over four years. With building costing an estimated N200 million and severance of N200 million, a former governor of Gombe could cost the state as much as N454.3 million over four years. With two former governors in the persons of Senator Danjuma Goje and Abubakar Hashidu, Gombe could have coughed out as much as N908.6 million Zamfara The Grant of Pension to Governor or Deputy Governor (Amendment Law) 2006 is the law guiding the provision of pension and other benefits to former governors of Zamfara State. It provides a pension for life equivalent to the salary of the incumbent, two personal staff, two vehicles replaceable every four years, two drivers, free medical for the former governors and deputies and their immediate families in Nigeria or abroad. The pension for the governor and his personal and domestic staff amount to N10.12 million and over four years could amount to N40.48 million. With the periodic roll over of two vehicles costing N20 million each, expenditure on a former governor of Zamfara State would amount every four years to N80.96 million. Zamfara State with two former governors in the persons of Senator Sani Yerima who conceived the law while in office in 2006 and his successor, former Governor Mahmud Shinkafi, the state would over four years expend N161.92 million maintaining them besides the open cheque for medical treatment in Nigeria or abroad for the former governor and members of his family. Imo There is a subsisting pension law in Imo State, for former governors and their deputies. Currently, the only beneficiaries of this law are the two former civilian governors, Chief Achike Udenwa and Chief Ikedi Ohakim, as well as their deputies, Engr. Ebere Udeagu and Mrs. Ada Okwuonu respectively. Vanguard gathered that none of the four benefitting personalities is currently occupying any public office in the country. The immediate past governor of the state, Chief Ohakim is, however, not a beneficiary, his media aide, Mr. Henry Ekpe told Vanguard. “The present administration has not paid Chief Ohakim a dime as pension, since he left office in 2011. He has not equally been paid his severance allowance up till today,” Mr. Ekpe said. Delta Provision of Pension Rights of the Executive Governor and Deputy of Delta State, 2005 is the law guiding the provision of pension for former governors and deputy governors of Delta State. Olorogun Felix Ovuodoroye Ibru, his deputy, Simon Ebonka, Chief James Onanefe Ibori and his deputy, Chief Benjamin Elue were the initial beneficiaries. As at today, Dr Emmanuel Eweta Uduaghan and his deputy, Prof Amos Agbe Utuama, SAN have joined the beneficiaries lists , following their disengagement from office in 2015 making them the sixth persons on the list until the demise of Olorogun Felix Ovuodoroye Ibru. The former Governors and their deputies are entitled to one duplex in any city of their choice within Nigeria, One jeep and a backup car replaceable every two years, an office with four staff, two security personnel and a monthly salary among others. With an average monthly salary of N100,000 for each of the four staff, the former governor’s N2.2 million annual salary, and two vehicles at N20 million each and replaceable every two years could bring expenditure on each former governor to N108 million every four years. With two former governors, Chief James Onanefe Ibori and Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, that would bring the official expenditure to N216 million besides the estimated N300 million each provision for building houses for each of the two governors bringing total expenditure to N816 million. Kano The law guiding pension rights for former governors of Kano State provides that the former governor and deputy governor should get 100% of the incumbent, a well equipped office, a six bedroom house and free medical treatment for the former governor and members of his family.

The former governor receives N200 million two vehicles replaceable every four years, two drivers, free medicals for himself and his immediate family and a house in the state capital and in Abuja. With salaries of two drivers earmarked at N360,000 per annum each and the former governor’s pension at N2.2 million and vehicles of N20 million each replaceable every four years, the former governor is also entitled to a building in Abuja and the state capital costing an estimated N300 million in Damaturu and N500 million in Abuja. The payments over four years could reach N51.68 million besides the N800 million provided for the building of two houses under the law. Jigawa The pension law in Jigawa State entitled Former Public officers Pension and other Benefits Law No 15 of 2015 stipulates that a governor who successfully completed his term without impeachment should be entitled to a monthly pension equivalent to the current salary of the current governor, two brand new vehicles to be provided by the state government and to be replaced after every four year,   six bedroom house fully furnished, two personal assistants not below grade level 10, two drivers selected by the governor and be paid by the state, a fully furnished office in any location of choice of the governor and fully paid medical treatment within Nigeria and abroad.

Niger The pension scheme in Niger State was introduced during the Abdulkadir Kure regime. It provides for the payment of pension to former governors and deputy governors and the provision of two drivers on GL 07, two personal assistants on Grade Level 08, security aides and an SUV renewable every year. The monetary cost of these to the state apart from security aides would amount to N26.5 million per year. That is besides the estimated N200 million it could take to provide a mansion for the former governor. Over a four year period, the cost on the state on each former governor would be N106.16 million and with the building it would amount to N300.16 million. The third civilian governor of the state, Engr. Abdulkadir Kure who has just died.   With two living former governors, Alhaji Awal Ibrahim, the emir of Suleja and with the immediate past governor, Dr. Babangida Aliyu and two living former deputy governors, the cost on the state would amount to N1.2 billion.

However only one Deputy Governor Garba Gadi(2007-2009) during Isa Yuguda is not a beneficiary of the law because he was impeached during his first tenure in office. Findings from Bauchi State Ministry of Justice revealed that  former Civilian Governors are paid the sum of N1.201,634.28 billion while former Deputy governors are paid the sum of N1,131,345.96 billion per annum.

Former governors are bearing an exerting pressure on national development with pension payments and other entitlements draining billions of naira every year from development funds for the states. January 23, 2017 In "News" The revelation that taxpayers spend N37 billion in sustaining the pension and other benefits for 47 former governors of 21 states is indeed shocking. February 2, 2017 In "Editorial" Thirty-two retired judges, including five retired state Chief Judges in Anambra State, led by Justice Godwin Ononiba (retd), have dragged Anambra State governor, Willie Obiano, to the National Industrial Court of Nigeria in Awka for non-payment of their severance gratuity, upward review of pensions, arrears of housing allowances and overall… December 23, 2016 In "Headlines"
