The directive was contained in a letter dated December 10th, 2019 and addressed to the Managing Director. In the letter, which was signed by the chairman, Ikharo Attah, the traffic team said: “We have noted with dismay the continuous traffic gridlock around the Wuse Market as vehicles enter the market.” Attah added: “Having studied the situation at Wuse Market for over two months, we have come to the conclusion that the problem lies within the market itself. A situation where vehicles are pouring into the market in geometric proportion and exiting in arithmetic proportion shows that something is significantly not adding up. Every market or shopping centre where vehicular traffic does not show a balance in entry and exit always experience chaotic gridlock inroads around them”. The traffic task team chairman pointed out that, “the FCT Administration having addressed the traffic problems at Nyanya, Dutsen-Alhaji, and Kubwa Expressway would not ignore the disturbing traffic problem around Wuse market which is located in the heart of the city.” The team, therefore, told the market managers to, “to immediately take urgent and bold steps to address the problem which has made it difficult to traverse roads around the market.” The task team chairman pointed out that the FCT minister, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello has been briefed on the issues, and has shown total commitment to addressing the problem. The traffic task team further warned that if the traffic problem is not immediately solved by the market managers, its members, “would move in and take very drastic steps that would restore traffic sanity in and around the market”.
