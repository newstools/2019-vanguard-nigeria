The blast took place at a checkpoint at a busy intersection in Mogadishu. Dr. Mohamed Yusuf, director of Madina hospital, told the AP news agency they had received 73 bodies. The death toll is expected to rise. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the bomb but al-Shabab militants have often carried out attacks there. Al-Shabab – a group of Islamist militants, allied to Al-Qaeda – has waged an insurgency for more than 10 years. It was forced out of the capital in 2011 but still controls areas of the country. Witnesses described carnage at the scene. “All I could see was scattered dead bodies … amid the blast and some of them burned beyond recognition,” said Sakariye Abdukadir, who was close to the blast. One Somali MP, Mohamed Abdirizak, put the death toll at more than 90, although the information he said he had received has not been independently confirmed. Many of the dead are reportedly university students. “May Allah have mercy on the victims of this barbaric attack,” the former internal security minister added. Five people were killed earlier this month when al-Shabab attacked a Mogadishu hotel popular with politicians, diplomats, and military officers. vanguard At least 276 people have been killed and 300 injured by a massive truck bomb that tore through a busy shopping district of Mogadishu, the government said Monday, making it the "deadliest attack ever" to hit war-torn Somalia.
