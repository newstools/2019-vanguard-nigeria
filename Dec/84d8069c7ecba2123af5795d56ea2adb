A Florida special education teacher was arrested Monday after allegedly having sex with her son’s 15-year-old friend “several hundred times” beginning last year, a report said. Susan Weddle, 40, and the teen allegedly kicked off their relationship at the woman’s Cantonment home after the two attended her son’s football game and started drinking, according to the Pensacola News Journal, citing an arrest report. The teen said once he was drunk, he convinced Weddle to have sex with him — even though she told him she knew it was wrong, the report said. From there, the pair then allegedly had a sexual relationship that lasted more than a year with dalliances at her house, his home, in her car and at the beach. “Weddle was his first and only sexual partner, and he believed himself to be in love with her,” the arrest report said. Weddle on Monday resigned from the J.E. Hall Center, where she helped train other teachers as a learning resource specialist, Escambia County School District Superintendent Malcolm Thomas told the paper. She worked there for 11 months. Before that position, she was a teacher at L.D. McArthur Elementary School, the report said. Several witnesses came forward to report the pair’s relationship, and in November a high school guidance counselor tipped off the Department of Children and Families. That witness alerted the counselor about discovering damning text messages between the teen and Weddle. Another witness, who was hired to pressure wash Weddle’s home in April, alerted the EscambiaCounty Sheriff’s Office that he saw the two kissing. The witness also told authorities the teen showed him nude photos of Weddle on his phone, according to the arrest report. Weddle allegedly gifted the teen with an iPhone, necklace, bracelet and other items during the relationship.
