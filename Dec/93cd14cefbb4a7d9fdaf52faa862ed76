The entire financial architecture of our country would benefit from this. This includes project financing, contract execution timeline, project implementation, and performance monitoring. It will make public procurement predictable, business climate stable, and give confidence to investors. “The party urges the executive and legislature to take full advantage of this new dawn of cordial relations. This will ultimately translate to better governance for the benefit of Nigerians.”  Vanguard  Alhaji Shehu Kawo, an All Progressives Congress(APC) Chieftian in Niger on Wednesday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for presenting “ a well focused’’ Budget to the National Assembly for the 2020 fiscal year.
