Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has terminated the appointment of Managing Director of the State Signage and Advertising Agency, LASAA, Mr. Bolaji Sanusi. Sanwo-Olu has announced the appointment of Mr. Adedamola Adekunjo as the new Managing Director with immediate effect. The former boss, Sanusi, who was appointed by immediate past administration of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, was shocked at development because he expected his appointment to be renewed being one of the loyalists of the National leader of All Progressives Congress, APC, Adiwaju Bola Tinubu. However, the actual reason for not approving Sanusi’s reappointment was uncertain at press time, but it was gathered that it was due to Sanwo-Olu’s on-going restructuring of revenue making agencies in the state towards the realization of 2020 budget aspirations. It was learnt that immediately, Sanusi’s appointment was terminated, the Governor directed the Head of Service, Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, to issue a letter of appointment to Adekunjo, despite the fact that the development happened on a weekend.
