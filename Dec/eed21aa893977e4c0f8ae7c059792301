The lecture will focus on looking at comparable models around the world, especially, the venture capitalist models used in building up wealth in US, China, India, and so many other countries. ” The Igbo Apprenticeship model is model is the longest, and perhaps, the largest informal venture capitalist system in the world. In order to re-engineer this model in this era, we need to identify those challenges with the current model and possibly proffer solutions for the present digital economy,” he said. He said that acts of sabotage and corruption has marred the system as being practiced today. He said the model can still be used to engage the unemployed graduates in Nigeria today, by mentoring them to explore opportunities in the ever changing world of the digital technologies.<img class="size-full wp-image-1304367 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?resize=44%2C58&amp;ssl=1 44w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?resize=146%2C194&amp;ssl=1 146w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?resize=98%2C130&amp;ssl=1 98w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ACHEBE2.jpg?resize=560%2C747&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Earlier in his welcome address, the Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Charles Igwe, said academic lectures are needed for effective collaboration between the town and gown in order to find solutions to challenges facing the nation.
