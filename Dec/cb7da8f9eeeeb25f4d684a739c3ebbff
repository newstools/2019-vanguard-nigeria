The group’s Coordinator, Comrade Saviour Udotai, during a briefing in Uyo, today, appealed for calm so that the law may take its course. According to Udotai “We have read with dismay several atrocious claims by sponsored agents over the detention of a miscreant named Michael Itok by the DSS over defamatory statements he published on facebook against the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel. “As concerned Akwa Ibomites who are desirous of partnering with the state government in the task of building a vibrant economy, we are constrained to state that the time has come for us to depart from acts of blackmail, hate speeches and fabricated lies that are spewed from a selfish point of view to de-market the state for pecuniary gains”. He said that it is common knowledge that the current Akwa Ibom State Government has shown a high level of tolerance to criticism and critics even in the face of sponsored malicious attacks and will continue to do so. On the detention of Michael Itok, he admonished against backward acts of blackmail, adding that those misguiding the public about facts of the case should allow the law take its full course, saying where and when they feel the law has fallen short of their expectations they should seek redress as provided by the extant laws of Nigeria.
