Akura was charged with criminal conspiracy and being in possession of 16 ATM cards suspected to be stolen, contrary to Sections 97 and 318 of the Penal Code Laws of Benue, 2004.

Ojata quoted the letter as saying that Akura, a 300 level student of BSU, was arrested with 16 ATM cards of different banks with different names, in an examination hall. The letter further said that when the accused person was questioned, he could not give satisfactory account of the ATM cards. The Prosecutor said that the accused person confessed, during Police investigation, that he had been sending the ATM cards to one Ayo James (now at large) who lives in Kaduna, who uses them in committing series of crimes.
