Grammy-nominated rapper A$AP Rocky has returned to Sweden for the first time since he was detained in a Stockholm street brawl. The 31-year-old performer arrived for a gig Wednesday at Stockholm’s Ericsson Globe nearly four months after he was found guilty of assault, Swedish outlet The Local reported. He will perform alongside local rap artists Jireel, Z.E and Dree Low in a concert to benefit the charity FARR, the Swedish Network of Refugee Support Groups. The “Praise the Lord” artist, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was behind bars for one month in Stockholm after he and two members of his entourage assaulted a teen. He was given a suspended sentence and ordered to pay a fine of 12,500 Swedish krona ($1,300) to the victim. The rapper vowed to still return to the country after receiving “tremendous support from the Swedish fans, ” including an online petition #JusticeforRocky.
