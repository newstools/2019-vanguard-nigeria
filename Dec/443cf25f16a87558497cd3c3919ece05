Irukera said that the stakeholder’s forum was to create a stronger bond between all players so as to develop standards and codes of conduct for associations that would be beneficial to government, economy and all others involved. “There are clear and statutory roles for collaborating with professional associations on how to regulate the entire market from a consumer protection standpoint. “The partnership with the associations will certainly provide an important platform for educating their members about their responsibility, their policy direction and the focus of the commission and it will provide the context to the commission making regulations and adopting policies. “We need to work together to develop standards and code of conduct for the association that will benefit consumers, associations, providers, producers, government and as well as the economy,” he said. The D-G suggested that associations should have policies within their associations that would be helpful in the regulations. He urged the public to contact the commission via telephone as well as its various social media platforms whenever a customer felt cheated or shortchanged.
