Security flop in Bayelsa, Kogi polls The party through its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan condemned the attack on Nigerians by hoodlums, allegedly sponsored by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration. It said that such attack on Nigerians holding a protest within their constitutionally guaranteed rights points to nothing but the furtherance of the suppressive plot by the APC and its leaders in government to subjugate Nigerians, foist a siege mentality on the citizenry and force them to surrender to a repressive rule. Read the statement below: “The world watched with shock as hoodlums chanting the “sai baba” slogan, known with supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC, violently descended on citizens peacefully protesting at the Nigerian Human Right Commission (NHRC) complex in Abuja, with dangerous weapons and abducted protesters in the full glare of security operatives. The PDP invites Nigerians to note how hoodlums were recruited to mask an orchestrated tyrannical design to subdue constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and opinion in our country.<img class="size-full wp-image-1311336 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130541.png?resize=513%2C376&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="513" height="376" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130541.png?w=513&amp;ssl=1 513w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130541.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130541.png?resize=58%2C43&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130541.png?resize=260%2C191&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130541.png?resize=177%2C130&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> By their chants, the public is not in doubt as to whose interest the hoodlums were deployed to serve by attacking Nigerians who were protesting the violation of rights in our country. The burden now lies at the doorstep of the APC and the Buhari administration. Our party challenges them to come out clean on this matter. The PDP reminds the APC and its administration to note that Nigeria is a democratic state governed by law and that such reprehensible designs against the citizens can only be a recipe for civil unrest and anarchy.<img class="size-full wp-image-1311335 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=640%2C302&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?w=663&amp;ssl=1 663w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=58%2C27&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=260%2C123&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=200%2C94&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=560%2C264&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1311335" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=640%2C302&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?w=663&amp;ssl=1 663w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=58%2C27&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=260%2C123&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=200%2C94&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20191223_130507.png?resize=560%2C264&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Rivers APC disintegrated before it was formed —Onyesoh The party therefore calls on security agencies to save the nation from a civil unrest by immediately arresting and prosecuting the culprits as well as provide adequate security for Nigerians exercising their civic rights, including the right to peaceful protest.” Watch video below:   Vanguard The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, yesterday described as dastardly, unwarranted and unprovoked,  the alleged attack on its leaders including national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Ekiti state governor, Ayodele Fayose and others while on a peaceful protest to Force headquarters and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC,… October 6, 2018 In "News" LAGOS—Barely eight days, after its controversial protest in Lagos, for the removal of Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Attahiru Jega, the Convener, Coalition of Concerned Nigerians, CCN and National Coordinator, Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC, Otunba Gani Adams, Tuesday, fired back at the All Progressives Congress, APC, saying his… March 25, 2015 In "News" The Benue state People Democratic Party, PDP, has accused the All Progressives Congress, APC, and retired Police Commissioner, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav of instigating the protest against the State government by a faction of pensioners in the state.
