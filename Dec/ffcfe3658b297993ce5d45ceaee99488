The state Head of Service, Mrs. Deborah Ogunmola, disclosed this to journalists in Lokoja, the state capital. She said the development was at the centre of the meeting she held with permanent secretaries and directors of finance and administration in the state civil service on Boxing Day.

She said the civil service reform carried out by Governor Yahaya Bello’s administration was the most thorough and result-driven in the history of the state.
