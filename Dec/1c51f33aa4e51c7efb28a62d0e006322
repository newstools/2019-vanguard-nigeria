The Reds missed out on finishing first by a single point as Manchester City triumphed for consecutive campaigns. This season, Jurgen Klopp’s side look on track to banish those demons and lead the league by 10 points with a game in hand. Liverpool did squander a seven-point lead last season, however, and Robertson admits that domestic slip up remains on his mind, even if the club’s Champions League triumph did provide some consolation. “Our total of 97 points wins 95 per cent of the Premier Leagues in previous years,” Robertson told the Liverpool Echo. “Unfortunately we were in the year where it wasn’t enough. “For us, that still hurts, missing out after such a fantastic season. It was eased by winning the Champions League and we can look back and say it was a successful season. “Without the Champions League, though, we couldn’t. It would have been a very long summer.We know how important every single game is because every point and every win and last-minute winner and clean sheet last season was so important. We fell short but pushed Man City all the way.” The Reds face second-placed Leicester City on Boxing Day in a potentially season-defining match with Robertson all too aware that they must maintain their consistency. Since being held to a draw with Manchester United, Klopp’s men have won eight straight league games and their left-back is desperate for that good run to continue. “This season, we have got a nice lead just now, but we know if we drop points then the two teams behind us will be ready to pounce,” Robertson said. “We just need to keep them at arm’s length, and if we keep doing that then we keep that gap. That has to be our aim. “We know it’s going to be tough and realistically games are going to get tougher, and if we do drop points then it’s all about bouncing back. We have done that so far.” After facing Leicester, Liverpool will host Wolves on December 29 before beginning 2020 at home against Sheffield United.
