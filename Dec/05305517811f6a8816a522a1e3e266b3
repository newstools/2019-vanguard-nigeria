Following is reaction from leaders around the world: U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP Trump said Johnson’s win meant Britain and the United States would be free to strike a “massive” new trade deal after Brexit. “This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the EU. Celebrate Boris,” Trump tweeted. EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT CHARLES MICHEL Michel said the EU was ready to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Britain but called on London to work in good faith. He said the EU hoped for a quick British parliamentary vote on withdrawal from the block. “We expect, as soon as possible, a vote by the British parliament … It’s important to have clarity,” he said. GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL “Congratulations, Boris Johnson, on your resounding victory. I look forward to working with you for the friendship and strong cooperation between our nations,” her spokesman tweeted. CZECH PRIME MINISTER ANDREJ BABIS Babis tweeted: “He is a charismatic leader, we share the same kind of thinking. He received strong mandate to deliver Brexit. I’m sorry that Czech Republic loses strong ally in the EU.” SPAIN’S ACTING PRIME MINISTER PEDRO SANCHEZ Sanchez tweeted: “We will continue to work for an orderly #Brexit that guarantees the rights and freedoms of citizens and provides certainty to economic sectors. We are committed to the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom.” RUSSIA’S KREMLIN SPOKESMAN DMITRY PESKOV “Of course we hope every time that political forces that win elections in any country share the ideology of and aim to build good relations with our country. I don’t know how appropriate such hopes are in the case of the Conservatives,” Peskov told reporters.
