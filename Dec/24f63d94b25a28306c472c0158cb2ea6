One of the winners, Mrs. Chinwe Okoroafor praised Three Crowns Milk for paying special attention to health and particularly, the role of mothers. In her words, “With the records which this brand holds, no one can be surprised at its increasing acceptance and patronage by people across all ages and across all areas in Nigeria. My family and I are for Three Crowns any day”; adding, “The transparency of this competition is very inspiring; the experience has been wonderful to me; and this outcome lifts my soul”. She promised to be an exemplary ambassador of Three Crowns Milk. The Marketing Manager, Three Crowns Milk, Omolara Banjoko explained that the aim of the campaign is to reward and celebrate every mum for her support and care, and as the heart of the home. She stressed that the campaign is to ensure mums are well taken care of, having done a lot to care for their families at their own expense. Banjoko further said: “Three Crowns supports families by providing high quality nutrition for mothers and by extension, their families. One of the key things that we have identified is that the foundation of any family is the mother and with them being the foundation, they need to stay fit and healthy which is what Three Crowns truly stands for.” Three Crowns Mum of the Year campaign debuted in 2015 with Olamide Olaleye emerging as winner, followed by Nkechi Brayila who won in 2016; Oluwakemi Longe in 2017; while three mums (Adaobi Okonkwo, Pauline Pambolo and Jennifer OtoGod) were crowned winners in the 2018 edition.
