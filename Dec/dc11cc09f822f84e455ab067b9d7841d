We are suspicious of their intentions. Also speaking on the development, the Chairman of Ajowa Akoko Community Hon Bakare Ajayi expressed fear over the occupation of the herdsmen. Ajayi pointed out that the “Ajowa community which is a gateway town needs a lot of consciousness. According to him ” our people have been battling with few herdsmen in their farms who usually use their cows to vandalise their crops. That’s not all we have also faced with security challenges such as kidnapping in this axis. He noted that ” our people needed to be security conscious as they saw in their luggage’s dangerous weapons such as axes, sharp cutlasses, and swords. However, the spokesperson of the herdsmen who identified himself as Issa Ahmed that some important indigenes in the communities collected money from them before the decision to come for settlement in the communities.
