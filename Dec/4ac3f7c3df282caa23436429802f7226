An oral health policy helps to harness political, economic and socio-cultural factors at the individual, family, community, national and international levels. Dr. Bola Alonge, Head of Dentistry Division in the ministry gave the assurance in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. Alonge said that stakeholders had on Dec. 17, reviewed the draft policy that was developed in 2012 and expired in 2015.
