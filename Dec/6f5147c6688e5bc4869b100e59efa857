The new Mac Pro released Tuesday, whose design has been likened to a giant cheese grater by tech geeks on Twitter, tops out at nearly $60,000 for customers who opt for all the bells and whistles. By comparison, the Performance version of the Model 3 Sedan, which features a carbon-fiber spoiler and top speed of 162 mph, sells for $56,990. The Mac Pro had already turned heads when it was announced in June with a starting price of $5,999. At the time, Apple had announced that the Mac Pro would be made in China. But in September it decided to keep production in Austin, Texas after US trade regulators approved 10 requests for tariff exemptions for computer parts. The Mac Pro is designed to be paired with Apple’s new $4,999 Pro Display XDR monitor, which can be upgraded to a nano-texture glass finish for an extra $1,000. The monitor is mounted on a “Pro Stand” that costs $999. But the real sticker shock comes for customers who are itching for power. Available upgrades include an additional $10,800 for beefed-up Radeon Pro Vega II Duo graphics cards, as well as $25,000 for 1.5 terabytes of DDR4 ECC memory. Also available is a stainless steel frame with wheels which costs $400, enabling the 40-pound super-computer to be wheeled around. Adding a Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad, as well as the display and Pro Stand, brings the grand total to $59,746. Luckily, Apple is advertising a promotion for its Apple Card which gives customers 6-percent back on purchases at its store through December. Putting down the titanium credit card would net you $3,584.76 in cashback. Shares of Apple ended up 0.6 percent on Tuesday, at $268.48.
