We want to add value to what I met on ground, so anybody that wants to help us to do what we are supposed to do, we are willing to partner with any who desirous of improving the waterways. “We are engaging the boat operators and we are going to enforce the law as it concerns the quality of boats, we have to insist on standards and any one that we think is not of the right quality and standard we will make that sure that it is not on our waterway.” On the wreck removal function, Moghalu said that its function to remove wrecks is limited to the internal waterways adding that every agency understands their own limit because the laws are clear on the responsibility of each government agency. ...Lagos moves to harness potentials, constructs 59 jetties across state Stakeholders in water transportation, comprising operators and passengers, have lamented the apparent neglect of what they consider one of the fastest and safest modes of transportation by various administrations at different levels of government.
