Fr. Joachim Ochibili, on Sunday in Lagos appealed to Nigerians to be patient with the Federal Government on its closure of Nigeria’s land borders.

The cleric spoke to NAN  on the sidelines of the church’s 2019 Cultural Fiesta with the theme: “Cultural Dance, Our Heritage for National Cohesion”. “Prices of goods have been going up, and people are really suffering as a result of it. “In spite of all these, there is still hope and we should still give God thanks. “In every situation, we must still see the bright side. “We should hope for the best;  that is why we should continue praying for Nigeria,” he said.
