In his presentation on Border Closure, the Comptroller General, Nigerian Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), explained that the measure had curved smuggling of prohibited items into the country. Ali also said it had raised the NCS daily revenue collection from N4 billion before the border closure to N6 billion. The NCS boss, who was represented by Comptroller Omiye Adesanmi, noted that smuggling of illicit drugs and weapons into the country had also drastically reduced. He explained that Nigeria has engaged Customs administrations of neighboring countries to comply with the ECOWAS protocol on transit of goods and persons, to protect Nigerian economy from the effects of smuggling. Ali pledged to seek stakeholders support including the media to ensure that the desired objectives of the exercise were fully achieved. He urged Nigerians to patronise local rice and other goods, to boost the nation’s economy.
