The executive secretary said: “Despite the challenges we faced; we are resolved and determined not to leave any child behind in the state. “In the course of the campaign, we have to deploy more vaccination team since we found out that the initial number of teams were inadequate. “We also have to extend the campaign for an additional one week. “During the additional days, we concentrated on areas that the campaign reached less number of children, according to our estimation and targets for various communities/areas in the campaign,“ he said. He said that the campaign was apt and enjoyed some advantage, which is getting the children immunised of Meningitis before the close of schools and the campaign coming at the beginning of the harmattan/dry season.
