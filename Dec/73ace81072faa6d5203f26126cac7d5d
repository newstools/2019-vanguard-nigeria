Heracles’ Nigerian forward Cyriel Dessers has won the Dutch Eredivisie Player of the Month award for November. Dessers who is the leading top scorer in the Netherlands with 11 goals, scored six goals in four league outings in the month under review. The 24-year-old scored a hat-trick against VVV Venlo on November 9 and gave Heracles a consolation goal in their 4-1 defeat to Ajax on November 23. Seven days later, he grabbed a brace that helped the Polman Stadion outfit romped to a 4-0 win over ADO Den Haag. Dessers is enjoyed a fine start to life in the city of Almelo since his arrival from Utrecht in July and has been directly involved in 16 goals in the league, including five assists. Born in Belgium to a Nigerian mother, the 24-year-old is eligible to play for the Super Eagles at the international level and has disclosed on-going talks with the Nigeria Football Federation over switching his allegiance to the African nation. “There’s already been contact with the NFF. After the match against ADO Den Haag (last Saturday), an official from Nigeria sent me a message that I was doing well,” Dessers told Sporza. “But it’s not going to be easy for me there either – there are over 300m Nigerians worldwide. “I have never been to Nigeria because of the political situation there. It was slightly better last year so I’ll be twice as happy if I can get an invite, even if it’s a friendly against Madagascar or Mauritius.” Source: Goal.com Vanguard News Manchester United defeated Anderlecht 2-1 (agg 3-2) thanks to an extra-time goal from Marcus Rashford, and secured a place in the Europa League semi-finals.
