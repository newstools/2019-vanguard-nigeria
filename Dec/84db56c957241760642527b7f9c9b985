A filmmaker has been slammed after he suggested that rape was ‘not a serious thing’ and that women should co-operate if they are being raped. Metro UK reports that Daniel Shravan also said that women should carry condoms in preparation for being raped as he tried to explain why ‘non-violent’ sex attacks should be legalised. He was speaking after vet Priyanka Reddy, 27, was raped by a man who offered to help her with a puncture last week. Her charred body was found under an overpass near Hyderabad in India last week. In his extraordinary outburst, he said ‘rape is not a serious thing, but murder is inexcusable.’ He also said ‘the government should legalise rape without violence for the safety of women.’ His argument was that once the ‘sexual desire is fulfilled, men wouldn’t kill women’, adding that women were being killed because they fought back or used pepper spray. He said: ‘Rapists are not finding a way to get their bodily sexual desires and getting these killing thoughts. An evil thought provokes crime (Killing). Better, women should accept Men’s Sex.’ Shravan also said that the Indian government was frightening rapists. His comments were roundly condemned and he later deleted the post after people said they would boycott his films. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1300617" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/film.jpg?resize=540%2C812&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="540" height="812" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/film.jpg?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/film.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/film.jpg?resize=39%2C58&amp;ssl=1 39w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/film.jpg?resize=129%2C194&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/film.jpg?resize=86%2C130&amp;ssl=1 86w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> One person said: ‘What kind of sick mentality does he have?

Her mother said she wants her daughter’s murderers to be burned alive. College student Sejal Kumar said: ‘We are not safe anymore in India. We are scared to move out of our homes.’ (Metro) Vanguard Nigeria News If recent reports are anything to go by, these are indeed strange times, especially in a country where there is an upsurge in girl-children being abused and robbed of their innocence by randy men who have become specialists in taking advantage of them and traumatising them in the process.
