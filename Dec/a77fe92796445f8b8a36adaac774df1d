Two young men ― an Afghan father of two (32 years) and an Iraqi (30 years) ― who were living in a hotel packed with refugees in northern Greece committed suicide over Christmas, a charity said Thursday. The two men were found in the village of Mouries near the border with North Macedonia. “We have terrible news from Mouries… two young men committed suicide yesterday and today,” the Greek Forum of Refugees said in a statement. It said they had been living in a hotel housing between 350 and 400 refugees in Mouries. The Afghan national was found on Wednesday hanging near a bridge not far from the hotel, while the Iraqi man was discovered by his roommate in one of the hotel corridors.
