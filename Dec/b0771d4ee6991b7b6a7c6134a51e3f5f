He said this in response to newsmen who asked him to compare his experience as Military Head of State to him being a democratically elected President.

“I put, based on almost all the geopolitical zones, committees to investigate them. “Those that were found to have lived beyond their means, the balance was taken and given to the states. “But I myself was arrested, detained and they were given back what they had stolen. “So, this system, which is supposed to be more accountable, is too slow for my liking, but I have to follow it.” VANGUARD There appears to be no backing down by President Muhammadu Buhari on his resolve to make anti-corruption and accountability the fulcrum of his administration as he issued fresh orders to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to account for funds that were stolen but recovered by the Commission.
