This revelation was made, weekend, at the launch of Tracka Federal Constituency Projects Tracking Report by BudgIT, a Nigerian civic organisation that applies technology for citizen engagement with institutional improvement to facilitate societal change. The Report revealed that out of the 1,497 projects tracked, 475 projects, representing 31.7 percent of the entire projects were completed. It further revealed that 144 projects or 9.6 percent are currently ongoing, 536 projects, representing 35.8 percent of the projects were yet to commence, 42 projects or 2.8 percent were considered as abandoned, while 224 projects, representing 15 percent of the entire projects had unspecified locations. The survey was carried out across only 26 states of the federation between June 2018 and November 2019.

In our view, efforts at boosting revenue generation, ensuring transparency and formulating proper policies to guide implementation would improve budget implementation.”  For an administration and a legislature looking for every opportunity to embarrass the other, the issue of constituency projects seems to be a readily available issue for dispute.
