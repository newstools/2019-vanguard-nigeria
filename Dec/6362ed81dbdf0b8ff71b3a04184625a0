The move is to enable the implementing partners to support the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS  and to provide the needed drugs to the affected persons in the state. The partners disclosed this  Friday at the end of a five-day workshop to develop the 2020 annual operational plan on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) in Akwanga Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. The  Institutional Capacity Strengthening Advisor of AHNi in charge of North-Central,  Dr. Terfa Kene said they are working to identify the 22, 000 HIV infected persons who have refused to make themselves available for tests and treatment. According to him,  once such persons are identified, tested and placed on drugs, it would go a long way in reducing the spread of the scourge in Nasarawa state. “If we are able to stop to spread of the scourge, it means that we are moving towards achieving a zero per cent spread,” he added. He, therefore, called on the infected persons to desist from self-inflicted stigmatisation and appealed to members of the public especially health personnel to stop discrimination against them by not disclosing their status. On his part, Zonal Team Lead, AHNi North-Central, Olukunle Daramola explained that the workshop was aimed at developing the 2020 plan to tackle HIV scourge in Nasarawa State. He said that with this strategic plan for 2020, areas of challenges and difficult terrains that need more attention would be given priority to see that HIV is eventually tackling in the state. “With this, we will nowhere to intervene more through sensitisation, drugs, and partnership with other stakeholders towards ending the spread of HIV in the state,” Daramola added.
