The army said the incident did not happen in Nigeria, and that the video was doctored and released by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The video showed some men held hostage in an open field before being shot dead by the insurgents, the video is yet to be confirmed. But in a statement, Sagir Musa, army spokesman, said a preliminary investigation showed the video as a tool of propaganda from IPOB. “The Nigerian Army wishes to emphatically state that there was no incident that involved the capture and killing of tens and tens of Nigerian soldiers on the 10th of December 2019, as mischievously and wickedly portrayed in the video,” the statement read. “Similarly, preliminary observation of the video clip (even by the amateur) will reveal that the video was doctored and that the event captured in the footage was not an occurrence that took place at any point in time within the shores of Nigeria. “To this end, the Nigerian Army is hereby calling on members of the general public and, indeed, personnel of the Nigerian Army, especially those in the North East theatre of operation, to disregard the video concocted and peddled by the outlawed IPOB members.” He added that the call by one Simon Ekpa who he said was the “principal actor in the clip”, on soldiers of south-east extraction to “return to Biafra proved it.” “Also, the call on South Easterners not to join the Nigerian Army is an obvious indication of the essence and objective of the masterminds of this fake video which should be discountenanced by the public,” Musa said. vanguard ... says it's the handiwork of IPOB By Kingsley Omonobi The Nigerian Army has described a trending video purporting that Boko Haram terrorists captured and killed several troops of Operation Lafiya Dole in the North East, as false and the handiwork of members of the outlawed Independent Peoples of Biafra.… December 12, 2019 In "News" The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and its Directorate of State, DOS, yesterday, alleged that the military is involved in ethnic cleansing against the people of South-East and Biafrans in general in the name of maintaining security.
