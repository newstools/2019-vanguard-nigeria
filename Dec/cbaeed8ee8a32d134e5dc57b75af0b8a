The under-recovery was incurred by the NNPC on behalf of the Federal Government. Under recovery is a situation whereby the NNPC incurs the cost of the differential between the official pump price of petrol and the actual cost of the commodity, especially as presently, the official price is lower than the actual market price. The difference with this current system of subsidy payment is the fact that since the NNPC is currently the sole importer of PMS, also known as petrol, into the country, the corporation is making the payments to itself or deducting the amount as cost from its revenue, and not paying it to other oil marketers as was the case in past subsidy regimes. On its financial performance for the month ended, September 30, 2019, the NNPC announced trading surplus of N8.59 billion, rising by 65.2 per cent compared to N5.20 billion surplus posted in August 2019. According to the NNPC, the significant increase of 65.2 per cent in September was due largely to the improved surplus posted by both the upstream and downstream subsidiaries of the NNPC; such as Integrated Data Services Limited, IDSL, Nigerian Gas Company, NGC; Nigerian Gas Marketing Company, NGMC; Petroleum Products Marketing Company, PPMC; Nigerian Pipelines and Storage Company, NPSC and Duke Oil Incorporated.

The NNPC added that the increased surplus was equally supplemented with reduced deficit posted by the refineries and the corporate headquarters.
