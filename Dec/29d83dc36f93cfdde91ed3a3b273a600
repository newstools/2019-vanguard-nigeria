The shares leaped to 35.2 riyal ($9.39) each, up from the IPO price of 32 riyals and at the daily limit of price moves allowed by the Tadawul exchange. That gives the state-owned oil giant a market value of about $1.88 trillion, comfortably making it the world’s most valuable listed company, although it will have one of the smallest “free floats” of publicly tradeable shares, at just 1.5%. Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) raised a record $25.6 billion in its IPO last week, giving it a market value of around $1.7 trillion. The flotation, a major challenge for the Riyadh stock exchange, propels the bourse into the world’s top 10 by value of listed companies. Saudi Arabia relied on mainly domestic and regional investors to buy Aramco shares after lukewarm interest from abroad. The $25.6 billion of proceeds beat Chinese tech firm Alibaba’s (BABA.N) $25 billion listings in 2014. “This is a successful IPO and the Aramco listing will add depth to the local market by providing exposure to a vital sector of Saudi Arabia’s economy,” said Bassel Khatoun, managing director, frontier and MENA at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity. “We are hopeful that Saudi Aramco uses the Tadawul listing as a springboard to an eventual international listing.” Source: Reuters Vanguard News The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, MBS in January, 2016 broke the news that global oil giants, Saudi Aramco would float a US$2 trillion Initial Public Offering, IPO in 2018.
