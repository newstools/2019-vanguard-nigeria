Ruiz Jr conceded the IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles back to Joshua six months after shockingly beating him, and put on over a stone between fights. He weighed in at 20st 3lbs, three stone more than Joshua. Giving several excuses for his loss, at a post-match conference,  Ruiz said he partied, became overweight and undertrained for the rematch which took place in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, December 7. Andy Ruiz said: “Three months of partying and celebrating affected me, what can I say? “Being overweight, I wasn’t fluid enough, I wasn’t moving the way I wanted to move. “I think if I’m lighter I’m going to let my hands go and be a completely different fighter.” When asked what he would have done differently if granted a rematch against Anthony Joshua, he said; “Listen to my coach. Listen to my dad. And take it more seriously. “I’m OK, I’m just a little disappointed. I should have listened to them. “I tried to do the training on my own. I should have listened to them more. “There’s no excuses…the partying and all that stuff got the best of me. “For being out of shape I did pretty good, I took all his shots.” Ruiz recognized that he lost a wide decision to Joshua but said he holds a victory too. He said the scores are tied with one win apiece and he wants a trilogy bout. “I know for the third one I’m going to be a lot better.” He added: “There’s a lot of responsibility being a champion of the world. I think the partying and all that stuff got the best of me. Next time it’ll be a lot better.” Here is the video below;  Vanguard Nigeria News By Tony Ubani Andy Ruiz Jr has admitted that his excessive partying following his victory over Anthony Joshua in June cost him in the rematch.
