News has learned. Per TMZ, which was first to report the news, the documents are expected to be filed on Tuesday. “Its a relief for both of them that they can move on legally from one another and fully put this behind them,” a source close to Hemsworth told E! News. “It was not a complicated divorce because of their prenup and it was all handled by attorneys. Their earnings were kept separate while they were married and that was helpful. They are both very much ready to move on and untangle whatever affairs were left to figure out. They are happy to close this chapter of their lives.” The news came about three weeks after fans learned the divorce case was still “not complete.” According to documents obtained by E! News, the superior court had notified Hemsworth his case could not proceed until he delivered his petition and summons to Cyrus and filed proof with the court. Had he failed to do so, Hemsworth would have had to appear in court on Jan. 21, 2020 and possibly pay a fine. As fans will recall, The Hunger Games star filed for divorce in August 2019 after less than a year of marriage. Hemsworth cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split. The filing came less than two weeks after fans first learned the celebrities had called it quits. “Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time,” Cyrus’ rep told E! News at the time. “Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what’s best while they both focus on themselves and careers. They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy.” Source: E-news Vanguard News Miley Cyrus has reportedly cancelled her wedding plans with Liam Hemsworth, as the two cannot get along with each other’s extreme personalities.
