Croat striker Mario Mandzukic has quit Juventus to join Al Duhail, the Qatari club announced Tuesday. According to local media, Mandzukic signed up on a two-and-a-half-year contract.

In his time with Juventus, where he arrived in 2015, he won four league titles, three Italian cups, a Supercup and was also part of the team that lost the 2017 Champions League final. He previously played for Dinamo Zagreb (2007-10), Wolfsburg (2010-12), Bayern Munich (2012-14) and Atletico Madrid (2014-15). With Bayern, Mandzukic won two Bundesliga titles as well as the 2013 Champions League.
