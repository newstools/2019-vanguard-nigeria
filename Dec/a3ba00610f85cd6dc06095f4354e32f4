Rashford has netted 10 and provided four assists in 16 league outings so far this season and has been particularly impressive in recent weeks. At only 22, Man Utd team-mate Matic believes there is a lot more to come from the England international, who has recently been compared to Cristiano Ronaldo. “Marcus has great potential,” Matic told Omnisport. “He’s a great guy also off the pitch, but I think he hasn’t used all his qualities yet. He needs to mature more and I can say every year, every month, he’s getting better and better. “I think in the future, in the next two or three years, he will show what he can really achieve because he can do much, much more in my opinion. But he’s still young. We can’t expect him to play 40 games at the same level because he’s still young, still learning, he’s still developing his body, his mentality. “He can be one of the best strikers in the world, for sure.” Source: Football 365 Vanguard News Manchester United will be missing five players for Saturday’s Premier League home game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, with Diogo Dalot to be rested, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera not fully fit and Nemanja Matic and Marcus Rashford suspended.
