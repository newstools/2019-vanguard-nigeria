He said this at the just concluded practical Nigerian Content Conference (PNC) in Yenagoa. His words: “What must be done to improve critical Infrastructure for the oil and gas sector to boost investment and increase industry activity? “Oilserv will execute a portion of the AKK project and still win big contracts due to the expertise of the firm and obvious fact that the company has grown tremendous capacity in the industry.” Also speaking recently, Chairman of Oilserv Group, Emeka Okwuosa said: ‘’ There was little or no indigenous participation in the EPC scope of activities, but Oilserv came in as a pioneer and changed the narrative based on my experience while working for Schlumberger internationally.” Okwuosa reiterated Oilserv’s resolve to not only be a leading indigenous company in the pipelines and facility business but also the company of choice. However, Oilserv, an engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning company, has been a major player in the sector since its inception in 1992.
