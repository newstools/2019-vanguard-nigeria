However, their leader is still at large. The source said; “Some months ago, there was this incident at MCC road where a boy was killed by suspected cultists. The boys that were arrested today are alleged to be members of the cult group that carried out the operation. “Now that examinations are on, they came out of hiding to write their examinations, but they never knew that the security agencies have been trailing them. “They were later taken away by the soldiers. Students of the Polytechnic were seen praising the soldiers over their arrest.” Commanding Officer, 14 Brigade, Ohafia, Brigadier General Solomon Kumapayi, confirmed the arrest of the suspected cultists and added that they will be handed over to the Police.
