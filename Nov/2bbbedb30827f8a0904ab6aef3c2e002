Lulu-Briggs Health Centre, which was built and donated to the University of Port Harcourt by the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation through the gracious benevolence of its grand benefactor, High Chief O. B. Lulu-Briggs, was the saving grace of the students of the University of Port Harcourt Demonstration Secondary School (UDSS). Reports by the medical staff on the ground at the health centre indicated that students of UDSS who were rushed in with complaints of stomach-aches on the suspicion of food poisoning, some of whom were brought in unconscious, were attended to immediately. No casualty was recorded on account of the emergency medical care administered by the O. B. Lulu-Briggs Health Centre. Parents of affected students at the University of Port Harcourt Demonstration Secondary School have continued to express gratitude to God and the medical staff of the O. B.
