The Black Friday, according to Hygeia was to ensure all Nigerians have access to quality and affordable healthcare. The offer which the HMO described as the best health insurance deals will hold began Friday, November 22nd & Friday, November 29th, 2019.  The two-day sale will give current and new customers the opportunity to buy healthcare plans at a discounted price. According to the Chief Executive officer of Hygeia HMO, Mr Obinnia Abajue, three of Hygeia HMO’s products that would be on sale are HyBasic, HyCheck, and HyCheck. The HyBasic plan will give individuals health cover up to N350, 000 for general consultations, minor surgeries, basic x-rays, diagnostic tests, etc, while the HyCheck and HyCheck Advanced plans allow the individual to take charge of his or her health and detect problems even before they start. “Every Nigerian deserves affordable coverage and high-quality care. For millions of Nigerians, quality healthcare is a luxury and with these sales, our already affordable healthcare plans become more affordable. We at Hygeia HMO will continue to contribute positively to the healthcare sector in Nigeria, and our Black Friday sale is a way of giving back to society”. He also stated that “Hygeia HMO drives to continually provide quality health insurance services that will continually enhance the quality of lives of Nigerians and the brand will always make meaningful contributions to the healthcare industry at large.” vanguard So essentially, there is huge market failure and that is why we are not making any tangible progress in the health sector July 10, 2018 In "Health" By Naomi Uzor Hygeia, owners of Lagoon Hospitals, Lagos have secured over $26m of strategic financial partnership with Satya Capital, IFC and FMO (the Netherlands Development Finance Company) to support the organisationâ€™s plans for considerable growth and quality improvements in key areas of its integrated healthcare business.
