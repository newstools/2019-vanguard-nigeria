Virtual PayPal Terminal: If you have tried receiving money using Paypal, one of the world’s largest internet payment companies, from other countries, you’ll agree that it is a no go area as Nigerians can only send and make payments on the platform but cannot receive money. Virtual PayPal Terminal is making this possible and with ease. The good thing about the new PayPal game-changer in Nigeria is that a lot of Nigerians can verify their identity on the platform before trading PayPal and observe a 3 days fund check against fraud before being paid. Speaking on why he came up with Virtual PayPal and how he intends to revolutionize e-transaction in the country, Vin Obieze, CEO, and co-founder of Virtual PayPal Terminal said, “As a values-driven company, we want to make the PayPal economy accessible for everyone in Nigeria, especially the underbanked. “To this end, we would like to reach as many young people as possible to help them understand the digital market of PayPal and help them receive their payments right here in Nigeria and transact safely and with confidence. “Our aim is to continue to partner with customers and other key stakeholders to ensure they are well informed about the opportunities presented by peer-to-peer PayPal finance.” Nigeria has a large economy and marketplace when it comes to e-commerce and digital business, with a lot of goods and services payment using PayPal since the activation of Nigerian users on the platform. Paypal has been criticized by Nigerian Internet entrepreneurs on numerous occasions for making the receiving option unavailable in Nigeria; the country with the largest internet penetration in Africa, and PayPal has done nothing about it. This has become a source of frustration for genuine e-transaction users who want to carry out e-commerce online but have no access to full PayPal features.
