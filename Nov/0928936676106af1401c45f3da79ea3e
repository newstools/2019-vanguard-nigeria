The meeting was attended by over 60 party chairmen including Hon. Perry Opara (National Unity Party), Alhaji Adamu Takai (Advanced Congress of Democrats) and Barr. Kenneth Udeze (Action Alliance), among others. The forum also called for the urgent amendment of the Electoral Act, electronic transmission of results and electronic accreditation of voters and if possible electronic voting.

Udeze said despite the deployments of thousands of security personnel for the elections, thugs had a field day particularly in Kogi State where their activities played a major role in determining who eventually won the election. He said:  “The failure of the elections was not caused by administrative lapses or inefficiency of the INEC, but by the treasonable actions of security agencies (Nigerian Army and Nigeria Police) who compromised the process and aided political thugs to disrupt the entire process and cart away electoral materials. “The collation centres were made inaccessible to duly accredited observers and agents of other political parties except those that were allowed by the thugs; while over 35,000 policemen watched helplessly and haplessly.”  Vanguard  ***Absolve INEC, Call for conclusion of Electoral Act amendment ...Say Police fail to arrest Masterminds of Election ViolenceBy Henry Umoru Sixty-two Chairmen of Nigeria Political Parties under the aegis of Forum of Chairmen of Nigeria Political Parties on Monday Indicted security agents and politicians over the violence and other electoral… November 25, 2019 In "News" The Forum of Chairmen of Nigeria Political Parties has indicted security agents and politicians over the violence and other electoral fraud witnessed during the just concluded Bayelsa/Kogi states governorship elections.
