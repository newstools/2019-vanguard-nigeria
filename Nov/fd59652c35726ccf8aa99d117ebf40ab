The agencies include, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, the Nigerian Immigration Service, NIS, the Department of State Security, DSS, the Nigerian Quarantine Service, NQS and others. The government’s directive was as a result of complaints by ship owners that most of these agencies are using the opportunity to extort the crew of ships that call at the nation’s ports. While it is normal for the NQS to first board a visiting ship alone, all the others are expected to board at the same time.

Also speaking on the issue, General Manager of the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, Igini, explained that it is important that all officials of the various government agencies should desist from taking tea or food to maintain their integrity. He stressed the need for a unified inspection regime by all the relevant government agencies.
