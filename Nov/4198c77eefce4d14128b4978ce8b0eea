He also urged the youth and the electorate to vote according to their conscience for development to thrive on the state. “Kogi governorship poll is our election and it is time for Kogi people to vote wisely and positively. “Let us look carefully and vote the candidate that will change our lives and will bring development to Kogi state. “We pray for peaceful, credible and fair election so that everybody will say his/her vote counted during the election. “It is in view of this that I want to call on all relevant stakeholders that will be involved in the election like the INEC, security agents to discharge their duties without fear or favour.
