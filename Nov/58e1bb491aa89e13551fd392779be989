The companies react When contacted Union Bank said: “We are in talks with the Exchange as we have applied for extension of compliance.” Meanwhile, a source close to Transcorp said: “The Company is aware of the free float deficiency and management is working closely with the NSE Council to meet the free float. We could have done this earlier before now but the market has not been favourable since last year but we hope that once the market is favourable, we will float more shares to the general public.” Leventis said: “We are aware of it as we have sought for extension.” Other defaulted companies did not respond to text /email messages sent to them as at press time. Stakeholders/operators’ reactions Stakeholders and operators in the stock market have expressed discomfort with the degree of defaults in this regulation. The Executive Vice Chairman, High Cap Securities, Mr. David Adonri said: “The inability of the companies to comply with the free float is worrisome. It is to ensure that stocks ownership in public companies is not concentrated in few hands and to prevent price manipulation and dearth of liquidity. The earlier the defaulters comply, the better it is for the integrity of the capital market.”<img class="size-full wp-image-1290498 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?resize=640%2C338&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?resize=58%2C31&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?resize=260%2C137&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?resize=200%2C106&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/companies.jpg?resize=560%2C296&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Managing Director/CEO, APT Securities & Funds Limited, Mallam Kasimu Kurfi said: “The situation depend on the market demand as long there is no demand it will take time to meet up the minimum flotation of 20 percent of the issued shares. You can see that despite effort of Dangote, still Dangote Cement Plc did not meet up with the minimum free float of shares over years after listing on the Exchange. The better way is to give more time to the defaulters otherwise they may delist which is not good for the market. In his remark, Managing Director/CEO, Sofunix Investment and Communications Limited and a Chartered Stock Broker, Mr. Sola Oni said: “The NSE requires quoted companies to have a minimum 20 percent of its paid up share capital as free float or at least the value of its free float should be equal to N40 billion on the day the company is admitted to the Daily Official List of  the Exchange. The philosophy of free float is to hedge against high level of lock-in shares held by the company’s promoters. “However, companies that fail to comply with the requirement have breached part of The Exchange’s Post Listing Requirements which they signed to uphold. It portrays them as not transparent and reduces effective public participation in the companies’ ownership. This can attract sanctions from the Exchange. “On the part of shareholders, a breach of free float rule obscures the real capitalization of such companies. It makes it difficult for shareholders to know the actual total value of a company for the purpose of investment decision. This particularly affects stockbrokers and other investment advisers in their advisory services on such companies.” Reacting, the spokesperson for Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria, ISAN, Mr. Moses Igbrude, said: “When market regulators failed or choose to bend the laws or their regulations to favour some players this scenario will be the case. Core investors “Before now, core investors were not allowed to own more than 51 percent or 60 percent. This will allow for free float of shares. In the name of attracting certain companies to list on Stock Exchange the regulation was removed and the implication is what we are seeing in the market. “The regulators also forgot that the strategic investors don’t trade their shares and it is the free float of shares in market that make prices. “The removal or non compliance to rule is one of the reasons why most delisted companies opted for that option, it made it a lot easy for a company with the intention to delist to gradually increase its percentage holdings over time by using their cronies to mop the shares. Share price of such stocks can easily be manipulated and it doesn’t reflect true market price, the likes of AG Leventis, Dangote group of listed companies fall in this category. “I strongly advise the NSE and SEC to have the boldness and confidence to address this issue if they really want to have a global or international market as they want us to believe. A free float of companies’ shares is one major criteria to measure transparent and credibility of Stock Exchange.” Vanguard Ashaka Cement Plc has voluntarily delisted from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for violation of the exchange free float deficiency provision of 20 per cent.
