In a statement issued in Lagos on Monday, Kashamu said the misfortunes that have befallen the PDP was long foretold and self-inflicted. He blamed it all on the National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus.” Senate president congratulates APC, Kogi, Bayelsa governors-elect The statement reads in part, “Secondus does not care about the interest of the PDP and its teeming members. He cares only about himself. He has long begun the process of emasculating the party through his many acts of impunity, high-handedness and crass arrogance as if he is the Lord of the Manor. “But, the Almighty Allah has used President Buhari and the APC to prove to him that power belongs to Him alone and He gives it to whoever he wants. That is why the PDP lost woefully in Bayelsa State after being in power for 20 years. “The theatrics leading to the election in Kogi State are all too familiar to be recounted. No thanks to Secondus’ bread and butter kind of politics.” Senator Kashamu described President Buhari and the APC as being more politically savvy, urging them to continue to capitalize on PDP’s weaknesses until it learns useful lessons and retraces its steps like the prodigal son. He urged President Buhari not to relent on his anti-corruption drive, saying it remains the unique selling point of the current administration. The former lawmaker, who represented Ogun East Senatorial District in the eighth Senate, said the long years of corruption has affected the economy negatively and it will take some time to fix it. “It is visible to all and sundry that President Buhari is on the right track in fixing the economy and improving infrastructure with several initiatives such as the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Deep Offshore Act, road and railways, among others.” Senator Kashamu said he remains a chieftain of the PDP whether Secondus likes it or not, adding that he will continue to fight for the right things to be done within the party Vanguard Nigeria News The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to caution members of the All Progressives Congress against any action that can cause violence during Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections November 5, 2015 In "News" NATIONAL leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP yesterday asked President Muhummadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC not to truncate the nation’s democracy by planning to manipulate the Bayelsa State Gubernatorial election against the wishes of the people, just as it cautioned the federal government against alleged moves… December 11, 2015 In "News" Ahead of the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States billed for November 21 and December 5 respectively, national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was inciting violence in these states.
