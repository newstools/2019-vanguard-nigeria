The Monologue Empire (TME) is here to deliver that message. “The Monologue Empire” is a community of storytellers, talented Nigerian actors fighting for the greater good of humanity through their arts. It is a performing art empire, a voice for the voiceless that seeks to heal many broken souls in the world through monologue, tackle social menace such as rape, child abuse, homelessness, Cyberbullying, domestic violence, drug abuse, hunger, gender discrimination, political misconducts, and as well connect good actors with top movie directors in the country. By connecting the actors with directors and producers, the director instead of gathering people for auditions and ending up not getting the desired actor or perfect actor for the role as he had imagined, only needs to visit The Monologue Empire’s media platforms right from his bedroom and scout for the perfect actor.
