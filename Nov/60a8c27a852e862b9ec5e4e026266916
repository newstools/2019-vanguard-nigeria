Justice Okon Abang, who disclosed this, said the date for the ruling would be made known at the close of work. He said the reason for the failed ruling was due to heavy workload on the court “On account of the heavy workload on this honourable court, the court shall reserve ruling on the bail application. “The ruling is not ready. The court will give another date at the close of work today,” Abang said.
