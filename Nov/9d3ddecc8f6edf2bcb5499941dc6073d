The launch of the Cybertruck pickup suffered a setback when its “armored glass” windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday. At the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power, and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when the windows of Tesla’s new vehicle shattered while being tested.

With a starting price of $39,900, Cybertruck’s angular body in gun-metal gray resembles an armored vehicle. Its website shows that immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck. Tesla plans to start manufacturing the truck around late 2021.
