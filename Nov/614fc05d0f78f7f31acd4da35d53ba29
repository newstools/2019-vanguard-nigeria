Mr Ologbondiyan was caught in the same plan as he has been alleged to have carried ballot boxes and papers to his private residence, a situation that was staunchly resisted by the people of his Ward who insisted on the power of the ballot. “How will such a person garner enough moral strength to address a press conference to condemn a largely credible process? He and other PDP leaders should accept the verdict of the people and clean their names in the face of heavy accusations against them. “We commend the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies for their excellent performance in ensuring fair conduct. “To the PDP, they should prepare for future elections with seriousness and stop claiming ‘danger to democracy’ when things don’t go their way.
