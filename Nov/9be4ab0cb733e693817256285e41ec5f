Meanwhile, the company recorded a four percent increase in Gross Written Premium (GWP) at N87.5 billion from N84.1 billion recorded in 2017. Chairman of the company, Gen.

The company’s total assets recorded 15 percent growth to N312.7billion from N271.9 billion. Agwai said, “The drivers of the significant growth in asset can be traced to the significant increase in annuity premium invested majorly in government debt securities, increase in reinsurance assets and investment properties. “On our part, we will not rest on our oars and will intensify our corporate strategy to identify the needs, behaviour and culture of our potential customers with an attentive ear to market-feedback and create products to address and protect the underlying risks the populace are susceptible to.” Vanguard Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc has recorded 13 percent growth in Gross Written Premium, GWP, which rose to N15.8 billion for the year ended 2018 from N14 billion    in the previous year.
