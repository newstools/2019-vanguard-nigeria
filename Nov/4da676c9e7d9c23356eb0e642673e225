A case of culpable homicide was being probed after the apparent freak shooting, KZN police confirmed. The weapon – believed to be a loaded shotgun – was brought to court as evidence. “It is alleged that the weapon was brought to court to be entered as evidence in a house robbery case when it accidentally discharged in court,” said Brigadier Jay Naicker. He said that the 51-year-old later died in hospital. “She was taken to hospital after she was struck by a bullet on the left of the hip.” “Unfortunately, we cannot divulge further information as the investigations are at a sensitive stage,” he said. Several people, including former Hawks KZN boss Johan Booysen, have expressed their shock at Ferreira-Watt’s death.
