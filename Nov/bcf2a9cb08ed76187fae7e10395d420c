The discourse, tagged ‘Upright for Nigeria, stand against corruption’, was to encourage citizens to be accountable in discharging their responsibilities to the nation and also challenge corrupt officials using the FoI instruments. “We know that Nigerians have the capacity to change and become good citizens by requesting for transparency and accountability,” she said. She said the Freedom of Information Act applies to all, urging the participants to collectively struggle to ensure full compliance with the FOI law by all segments of the society. Obi stressed that ActionAid would continue to focus its campaigns in upholding values of honesty, integrity transparency and accountability.
