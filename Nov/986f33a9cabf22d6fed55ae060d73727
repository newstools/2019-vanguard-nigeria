Dr Felicia Aibinuomo, the FCT Communication Consultant for UNICEF, made this known at a one-day media orientation
on Tuesday in Abuja, saying that the meningitis vaccines were for children between the age of one and five years. She said that the measles vaccines were for children between nine months and five years, to be carried out in the six area councils of the FCT. According to her, the two diseases which are airborne, are common in the southern part of the Sahara which usually occurs during the dry season. Aibinuomo said “the media is expected to create awareness about this programme so as to inform parents
and caregivers to take children to different centres to receive the vaccines. “We want to ensure that our target group in the 358 healthcare centres are captured in the exercise.” Hajiya Rukayat Wamako, the Acting Director of the FCT Primary Health Care Board, also
appealed to the media to inform and educate residents about the programme “to save children from being victims of the diseases.” According to her, the vaccination is a facility-based programme and that is why the awareness is necessary to enable people to
move out of their houses to access it. “We need to do a lot of orientation for this meningitis vaccination to save our children; the programme is geared toward
drawing community dwellers to access the facilities. “It is a national programme and it is taking place all over the nation, where 664 teams of both public and private groups
will be participating.” Dr Iwot Ndaeyo, the acting Executive Secretary of the board, who disclosed that the board was targeting over 6000 children in the FCT,
urged parents and guardians to take the exercise seriously. He said that the ailments were associated with the dust of dry season and that preventive measures were
necessary before the season set in. Ndaeyo added that the vaccination was a second chance to children who did not meet up with the first exercise at the period they attained
nine months. He noted that the security apparatus had been drafted by the board to guarantee peoples’ lives
during the exercise.
