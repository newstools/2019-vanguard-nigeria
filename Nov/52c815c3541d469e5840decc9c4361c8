Igali stated this in a statement signed by himself, where he advised governorship candidates of various political parties and their supporters, including the electorates to see themselves​ as one big family not to be divided because of electing a new governor. It could be recalled that he (Igali) was one of the governorship aspirants under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who was also former Secretary to the Bayelsa State Government. He said: “As we get set to travel to various locations around our beloved state to cast our votes to elect a new Governor for Bayelsa State on November 16, 2019, I want to call on all Bayelsans to do so in an atmosphere of peace, fraternal love and true kinship which we all share. “In all modern democracies, elections have become necessary aspects of our social existence and experience. So there is nothing exceptionally new about Saturday, November 16, 2019. “This election, which is indeed local, must, therefore, be seen and appreciated as a healthy contest within the wider family. We must remember our age-old Izon adage which says “binaotu anda, ongbo yainghamini” – a wrestling bout between siblings must not result in broken bones. “This election is a routine game within the family which must come and go. We must, therefore, eschew wild desperation to hold on to power and influence or uncontrolled fight for office. Worse still is the rising spirit of hostility and easy resort to intimidation and violence. The crescendo of accusations and counter-accusations must be halted immediately. Oh Bayelsa Leaders and Politicians, let’s bridle our tongues and season our words! “The sanctity of the lives of our youths and vulnerable groups must be upheld and protected. Let all take heed and remind others of our Ijaw inevitable retributive justice of DUWEIYAI!” He also urged the electorates to shun all forms of financial inducements in the name of vote-buying, rather be conscious of their future including that of their children and grandchildren. “The shameful blight of undue money politics, financial inducement and open vote buying in our relatively backward state must be shunned and resisted. “We must imbibe the spirit of fair-play, mutual forbearance, and equanimity. After all, we are the home and “Jerusalem” of the Ijaw Nation and all closely knitted together in one spirit. “Let us remember that by the end of the day, only one winner will emerge. Let us not forget, that the “Day After”, we will still live together, go to the same churches, attend the same social functions and still have a state to collectively build. Let us not be carried away to believe that the great challenges confronting us and the battles which we must fight to leave an enviable legacy for our children in this complex polity in which we find ourselves are over. Conversely, remember that we need one another, the more, even after the election. “Though we are small, because of our strategic importance, the entire world is watching us. This is to the extent of several countries and organizations sending hundreds of very precious persons to be with us, on our soil and in our creeks and waterways in the next few days. We must show them great welcome, hospitality, and protection”, he said. He also advised the electorates to cooperate with theIndependent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and be law-abiding. “We must fully cooperative with our electoral umpire INEC and its service personnel, especially NYSC volunteers as well as the respective law enforcement agencies and try the best to ensure their full safety and well-being, even as we pray they carry out their tasks dispassionately”, he added. vanguard YENAGOA—FORMER President Goodluck Jonathan and three governorship aspirants in Bayelsa State— former Federal Permanent Secretary, Ambassador Godknows Igali;former Coordinator of Presidential Amnesty, PAP, Mr Timi Alaibe, and Mr. Erepamo Osaisai— spoke, yesterday, on how to ensure a violence-free governorship election in the state in November. July 11, 2019 In "News" Given the pedigree of aspirants jostling for the party's ticket, some concerned party chieftains are of the view that as they approach the primaries, the PDP, without sentiments, should look inward and carefully support an aspirant that is sellable and can win the election convincingly. July 10, 2019 In "News" Until recently, I did not take keen interest in who becomes the next governor of Bayelsa State, but recent defection of some bigwigs of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) since the emergence of the latter, as the ruling party, has attracted my attention to… August 23, 2015 In "Special Report"
