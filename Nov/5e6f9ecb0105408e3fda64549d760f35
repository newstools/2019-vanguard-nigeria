Just like the Honourable Minister said, if the federal government can make policies that will make people to know that it is not the amount of money in your bank account that matters, rather, your efforts in nation-building process and support of the masses. “President Muhammadu Buhari led administration has achieved a lot for the nation through the land border closure which has further made us to realize our potentials as the giant of Africa.
