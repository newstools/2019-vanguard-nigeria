Hassan of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos, adjourned the arraignment of Ismaila Mustapha ( a.k.a Mompha) associates, Kolade Phillip and Hamza Koudeih to November 28, 2019. When the matter was called today, the 2nd defendant’s counsel, Abdulhamid Mohammed told the court that he was only informed of the arraignment earlier in the day and doesn’t have a copy of the charge. He pleaded with the court for a short adjournment to enable him study the charge and prepare his client before the plea is taken. “I am not adequately prepared for the plea to be taken in respect of the 2nd defendant and I humbly urge the court to adjourn this matter to the earliest possible date”. The prosecution counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo opposed the application, arguing that the plea relevant to the jurisdiction of the court was not that of the counsel. Rotimi relying on S271(2&3) of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act, stated that the defendant had been served with the charge and he knows what to do with it. He, therefore, urged the court to discountenance the prayers of the defence and allow his plea to be taken. Justice Hassan, however, adjourned the matter until Thursday, November 28 for arraignment.
