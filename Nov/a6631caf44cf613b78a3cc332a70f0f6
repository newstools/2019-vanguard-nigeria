Hospitality management covers hotels, restaurants, cruise ships, amusement parks, destination marketing organisations, convention centres, country clubs and many more. The services of hospitality managers have been on growing demand in the last decade, this may be attributed to the increasing need for hospitality services. ADP Workforce Vitality Report (WVR), a US cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) reported in 2018 that it has seen consistent growth in employment and wages for the leisure and hospitality industry in 2016 and 2017, and there are no signs that the trend is going to slow down. The ADP WVR further noted that in the fourth quarter of 2017, full-time job holders in the hospitality industry experienced wage growth of 4.7%. Also, full-time employees who switched jobs within the hospitality industry saw a 6.3% increase in wages. This is more than any other industry wage growth for people who switched jobs. A 2018 Jumia Travel Hospitality Report (Nigeria) noted that travel and tourism were directly responsible for 1.9% of Nigeria’s total GDP. The report further predicted a rise of 2.9% by the end of 2018. Also, it noted that from a wider perspective, it is estimated that between 2018 – 2028, travel and tourism will contribute 4.3% to Nigeria’s GDP  year-on-year. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1288710 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=640%2C298&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hospitality Management" width="640" height="298" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=768%2C357&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=58%2C27&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=260%2C121&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=200%2C93&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unicaf2.jpg?resize=560%2C260&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" />  Source: Hospitality Report Nigeria 2018 by Jumia Travel  The booming hospitality sector in Nigeria, Africa and the global market in general, translate into increased demand for hospitality professionals.
