The former Lagos State governor, Fashola while speaking on the state of roads in Nigeria said although he can presume the headline the media will be casting, “the [Nigerian] roads are not that bad,” In response to what some Nigerians perceived as the insensitivity of the Minister (Fashola), they stormed Vanguard social media pages to express their discontent with pictures of bad roads they are aware of. Most of them stated the minister could make such a bold statement because he travels by air and not by roads to experience what a typical Nigerian faces every day. @Prettycobham reply: Is this road not in Nigeria? pic.twitter.com/OC6wuykPnb — Ekaette (@Prettycobham) November 7, 2019  @BiafraSk reply: <img class="wp-image-1286247 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=302%2C503&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="302" height="503" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=180%2C300&amp;ssl=1 180w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=35%2C58&amp;ssl=1 35w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=116%2C194&amp;ssl=1 116w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?resize=78%2C130&amp;ssl=1 78w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.jpg?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> @BiafraSk reply: <img class="wp-image-1286249 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?resize=361%2C481&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="361" height="481" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?resize=44%2C58&amp;ssl=1 44w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?resize=146%2C194&amp;ssl=1 146w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?resize=98%2C130&amp;ssl=1 98w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?w=270&amp;ssl=1 270w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Also in response, the Nigeria opposition party, People Democratic Party (PDP) urge the Nigerian minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola, to resign and tender apology to Nigerians for making what they described as an unpardonable comment. @ATTAHCLEMENT7: Tell BRF Akure -Ado Ekiti road is not hype o.
