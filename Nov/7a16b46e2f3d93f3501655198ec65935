A deep insight into this statement tells of the relevance of educating a girl child. In Africa, women are believed to be the newborn child’s primary caregiver; the paid nanny, the forbearing grandmother, or an elder sister is likely to take care of a child especially during the critical years of that child. The care provided by these women encompasses even the very health of that child. In a way to elaborate this quote, let’s take a brief look at the biography and impact of certain women in the health sector of Nigeria.  Professor Dora Nkem Akunyili was the Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) of Nigeria from 2001 to 2008. EDUCATION / CAREER Dora Nkem Akunyili obtained her first degree in Pharmacology in 1978 at the University of Nigeria, Enugu State. This marked the beginning of her journey to impact greatly in the health sector of Nigeria. She was trained as a pharmacist with a PhD in ethnopharmacology from the University of London, UK. She worked as chief executive of the southeast zone for Petroleum Special Trust Fund. HER INTEGRITY One important virtue that created opportunities for Dora Nkem Akunyili in the early years of her career and the drive that kept her going despite her challenges was her integrity. Dora Nkem Akunyili was sent to London for surgery to treat a pancreatic problem and was given €12 000 for medical costs. The physician found out she didn’t need the surgery, therefore she returned the money. The chief executive of the Petroleum Special Trust Fund was shocked and he said, “I never knew that there are still Nigerians with integrity “. HER APPOINTMENT Later, the minister of finance was visiting the offices and called her in. He said, “My friend Chief Obasanjo wants somebody that will clean NAFDAC, go and give me your CV because I also heard you are a pharmacist “. Akunyili met with Obasanjo to discuss the job and a few months later, her name was announced. HER CHALLENGES She faced challenges of lack of confidence at her early career stages, life-threatening situations and failed assassination attempts. But she was still resilient. ACHIEVEMENTS Despite being a woman and all the challenges she faced, Dora Akunyili depicts the character of a strong leader who fearlessly battled the greed and ignorance that allowed drug counterfeiting to thrive in Nigeria. At that time, over 60% of drugs in Nigeria were believed to be fake from China, India or factories in the southern part of Nigeria (pulse.ng). Her sister being a diabetic, died aged 21 yrs after taking fake insulin. This led to her fierce determination to eradicate all fake drugs in Nigeria. During her tenure as the Director-General of NAFDAC, the proportion of fake drugs sold in Nigeria drastically reduced by about 90%. Akunyili also worked on the sanitation of ‘pure water’ to significantly reduce the outbreak of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever.

ACHIEVEMENTS Ogbadu initiated the technology transfer on the “Temporary Immersion Bioreactor System” from Cuba into Nigeria for mass production of elite plantlets. She also facilitated the signing of a memorandum of understanding on vaccine production between Finley of Cuba and Nigeria in early 2013. Ogbadu restored Nigeria’s membership of International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. NABDA under Ogbadu’s leadership developed probes and primers for detecting Ebola virus disease at the outset of the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic. The kits developed were capable of diagnoses within 24 hours of contacting the virus even before the symptom start manifesting, therefore preventing the spread of the disease. These among many others have remarkably contributed to the growth and development of the health sector of Nigeria however these figures and the sacrifices they made still remain unknown to many young Nigerians.
