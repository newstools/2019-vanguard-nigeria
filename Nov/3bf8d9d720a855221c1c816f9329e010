Nollywood actor cum politician, Yul Edochie has come out to say he will never pray for his enemies and wish them well, as he does not believe in wishing an enemy well, while the enemy is out to do him evil. In a post on his twitter handle, the actor tweeted: ”I don’t believe in praying for my enemies and wishing them well. You can’t be planning evil for me and I’ll be busy praying for you. Lie lie!! I wish you what you wish me. Simple.  And every day I’ll be firing psalm 35 and psalm 109 on your head”.
