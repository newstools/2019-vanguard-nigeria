The defendant, whose house address was not given, was arraigned on charges of breach of peace and assault. The prosecutor, Insp Emmanuel Abdullahi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Nov. 5, 2019 at about 12 p.m. at Camp area, Ile-Ife. Abdullahi said that the defendant conducted himself in a manner that was likely to cause the breach of peace by beating one Oyetunde Simiatu.
