Dear Bunmi, <img class="size-full wp-image-951273 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/love1.jpg?resize=500%2C363&#038;ssl=1" alt="women, men" width="500" height="363" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/love1.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/love1.jpg?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/love1.jpg?resize=58%2C42&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/love1.jpg?resize=260%2C189&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/love1.jpg?resize=179%2C130&amp;ssl=1 179w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> My mother and I returned to Nigeria when I was five, after a bitter divorce. My dad remained abroad and we rarely heard from him. Mum later met and married another man who raised me and my brother as his own. We have two half siblings. Growing up, I always dreamt of this society wedding I often read about in the soft sell. Late last year, my boyfriend of four years proposed to me and we’ve planned a December wedding. My parents have offered to pay for part of the wedding, but as none of us has much money in savings, we had settled for a small wedding and reception. Then out of the blues, my real father got in touch. He said he’d heard I was getting married and wanted to help. He’s offered to pay for the whole wedding, and said money was no problem.

Your mum and step dad are the ones who have been there for you throughout your life, not your dad. Have the small wedding you’ve planned, with the people you love around you. If your real dad has money to throw around, let him know it wouldn’t be used for the wedding. That way, he might stay back and not steal your step dad’s ‘thunder’ on your wedding day.   “After Michael proposed, we both went to my parents to give them the good news. As soon as they got glimpse of the sparkling engagement ring, they were ecstatic. ‘You’ve got a good man here, Lynda’, my mum beamed.  `My son-in-law to be!’ dad added, giving Mike a very warm… April 7, 2019 In "Relationships" Had I properly investigated the family?  Well, what was there to investigate?  This was not the dark ages for heaven’s sake!  She in turn decided to pay a visit to  Tinuola’s family with dad so as to get to know them better.
