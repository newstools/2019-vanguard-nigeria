The service’s Deputy Director, Alhaji Bashir Bello, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Birnin Kebbi that the fire incidents took place between January to October. “From January to October 2019, we have recorded 113 fire incidents and eight deaths in the process. “The incidents occurred on these dates of Jan. 22, Feb. 28, March 22, April 11, May 9, June 4, July 7, Aug. 2, Sept. 5 and Oct. 3,” he said. Bello said to prevent further fire outbreaks in the state, it was imperative for the residents to always be careful in handling electrical appliances and other inflammable items. He attributed the incidents to mismanagement of electrical appliances, electricity surge, improper use of inflammable items and engagement of unqualified electricians. Bello also enjoined smokers to always ensure that cigarette butts were properly disposed of especially when in the grassy areas. According to him, the service currently does not have a functional vehicle for quickly responding to incidences in the state. “The fire department is only managing two rickety-old trucks out of nine trucks of which seven are grounded,’’ he said. Bello appealed to the State Government to adequately equip the department for prompt responses to distress calls and fire emergencies across the state. Vanguard News Nigeria.
