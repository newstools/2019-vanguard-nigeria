Oman jumped into a two-goal lead thanks to Eid Al Farsi’s left-footed, curling rocket into the far corner from distance and Jalal Al Sinani’s impressive scissor kick. Emeka Ogbonna responded to the early letdown by scoring two goals and bringing the Super Sand Eagles level early in the second period. However Oman just had too much for Nigeria as goals from Mushel Al Araimi, Al Farsi and Sami Al Bulushi had them 5-2 up at the end of the second period.
