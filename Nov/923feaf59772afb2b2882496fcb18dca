There were no complications during the operation in the early hours of Saturday, a police spokesman said. There were also no effects on the airport’s flight schedule on Saturday, said airport spokesman Daniel Tolksdorf. “Everything is going according to plan. “The place where the bomb was found is quite far from the terminal,” he said. Air traffic was interrupted for about an hour at the airport on Friday after the bomb was found at 12:20 pm (1120 GMT). Six incoming aircraft were diverted to Tegel, Berlin’s other main airport, during the interruption. Six take-offs were also delayed by about an hour. The bomb was discovered during repair work on a taxiway, a spokesman said. Asphalt surfaces are being laid on Taxiway G, which runs parallel to the runway between the terminals and the take-off and landing strip.
