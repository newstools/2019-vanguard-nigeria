This is why I felt that we must have a platform through which police misconduct can be reported by the people and we have set up what we call Citizens Complainants Hot Centre. This center has ten dedicated telephone lines, which will be operational for 24 hours. “The purpose of this is to identify policemen and officers who don’t want to key into a safety partnership.
