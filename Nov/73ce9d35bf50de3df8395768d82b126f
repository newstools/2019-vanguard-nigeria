The governor said: “The administration has embarked on several laudable projects and programmes which will undoubtedly impact on lives of the people of the state. “Our numerous development partners who left as a result of the unconducive environment in the last administration are not only back but have signed pacts with our administration to develop the state. “For instance, major investors in the agriculture and industrial sectors have signed business pacts with the state government.” Fayemi disclosed that part of the support from development partners was the 1000km rural roads that would be constructed under the Rural Access and Agriculture Marketing Programme (RAMP) of the World Bank and the French Development Agency (AFD). The project, according to him, will commence in January 2020, as soon as financing agreements are signed.
