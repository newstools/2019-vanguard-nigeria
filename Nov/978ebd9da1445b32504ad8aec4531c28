The Police Public Relations Officer of the command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, told  Newsmen in Ado-Ekiti that the corpses of the drowned students had been retrieved and deposited at a morgue. “We learnt the students went to the river to swim and got drowned. Their bodies had been taken to the mortuary,’’ Ikechukwu said. He added that full investigations had begun into the circumstances behind the incident. NAN learnt from an anonymous source in the school that about seven students had, on Friday, scaled the school fence to go for the swimming expedition, during which two of them got drowned. The source quoted one of the survivors as saying that although four of them jumped into the river, the two victims could not come out alive. “Those on the river cliff had to raise the alarm for rescue,” the sources said, adding that it was a farmer working nearby, with the help of some local divers, who rescued two of the students. “They later brought out the bodies of the two other boys,’’ the source said. About seven students were reported to have scaled the fence when academic works were ongoing to swim in the river, where two of them were drowned.
