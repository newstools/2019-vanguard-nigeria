He, however, commended the people of Toru-Orua for their turnout during the election, saying “your passion for positive change is commendable.’’ “We have not witnessed any breach of law and order in the community since the process began, our people have conducted themselves orderly. “As you can see, voting is also ongoing, and the process is orderly, we pray it continues this way till the end,’’ the governor added.
