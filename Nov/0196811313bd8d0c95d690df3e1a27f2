Okowa said: “The projected debt of the state is about N200 billion but we are spending a reasonable amount of money to service the debts, and that is not impinging on our ability to execute projects or pay salaries. “The time we had challenges was 2015, 2016 and 2017. Right now we can comfortably pay back the debts on a monthly basis, have money for capital expenditure and be able to pay salaries. So we don’t have any issue”. The Delta Governor maintained that the debts were not accumulated by the present administration, expressing confidence that any debt incurred since 2015 would be cleared before he leaves office in 2023. In his remarks, Speaker of the House, Chief Sheriff Oborevwori, said the 2020 budget of sustained development was another milestone in the rapid transformation and development that the state has witnessed since the beginning of the present administration.
