Former Barcelona midfielder Emmanuel Petit has launched an extraordinary attack on Neymar, accusing him of not having any respect for Paris Saint-Germain. Neymar tried to manoeuvre an exit from PSG last summer, either to return to Barcelona or join their fierce rivals Real Madrid. Petit does not believe Neymar is as good as the best players he played alongside in his own career and also criticised the Brazilian’s attitude. “When I played with Zidane or Djorkaeff, I knew they were able to decide a game on their own, so we accepted their defensive neglect,” Petit told RMC Sport. “We accepted it and did our job because we knew they could win with a flash of genius. “This is not the case, at all, with Neymar. This guy plays for him, and only for him. “Put yourself in the place of the boys in the place of the PSG dressing room, who live for months with the whims of this guy who s**** on the club and their supporters; he has no respect.” DailyMail reported Petit to have said. Neymar was given a frosty reception from PSG fans when he eventually returned to the first-team setup in September. He has scored four goals in seven matches since then and PSG are already the runaway leaders in Ligue 1. They are five points ahead of second-place Marseille and are next in action on Sunday, when they travel to Monaco. Vanguard News Nigeria.
