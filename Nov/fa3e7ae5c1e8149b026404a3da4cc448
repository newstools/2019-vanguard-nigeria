At some points we will be able to communicate with FIFA. “We are going to be very realistic. We have between now and January to meet up with everything they require. “We will look at it within the limit of time and our resources, and then we can both reach a joint decision with FIFA to say, will Nigeria be ready at that point in time. “It goes beyond being given the rights. We must also have the facilities up and running.
