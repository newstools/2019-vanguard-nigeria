Fabinho, who has played in all but one of Liverpool’s Premier League games this season, limped off in the first half after team-mate Dejan Lovren attempted to tackle Hirving Lozano. He was replaced by Georginio Wijnaldum in the 19th minute and is banned for Liverpool’s Premier League fixture against Brighton on Saturday, but Klopp will be keen to have him back for the Merseyside derby next Wednesday. “The biggest thing is the Fabinho injury, that’s massive,” said Klopp. “It’s early and we all hope it’s not too serious but it’s pretty painful and in an area you don’t want to have pain, around the ankle.” Asked by reporters how serious the injury could be, Klopp added: “I don’t want to say what I expect because I hope it is not serious. “He has pain, which is not good. He couldn’t continue. I hope it is not that serious. We’ll know more maybe tomorrow or the day after.” Source: Sky Sports Vanguard News Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has been ruled out for "the next few weeks" by boss Jurgen Klopp after suffering a calf injury in the 4-1 win over Norwich.
