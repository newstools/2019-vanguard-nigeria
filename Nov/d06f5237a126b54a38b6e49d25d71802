The last three wins for City have been an aggregate of 12-0 and there’s no reason to suggest they can’t stick another boat load of goals against them yet again, even if Shakhtar are battling with Dinamo Zagreb for the second qualification spot in the group behind City. Competition form is strong for Pep Guardiola’s side having won their last six home games, banging in 26 goals in the process – resulting in a mightily impressive 4.33 goals per game while conceding less than one. The Miners have actually travelled well in the group so far, playing out entertaining 2-2 and 3-3 draws in their two away days so far – and they’ve incredibly scored three goals in injury time. That seems way out of reach for them at the Etihad, though, and limiting the damage is probably the peak of their ambition given that any team Guardiola puts out will be far too good. He desperately wants to win this competition and would like the group wrapped up before the final game.
