This was disclosed by INEC supervisory resident electoral commissioner for Ogbia LGA identified as Ukuachukwu Orji. He said that members of the Ologi community forcibly prevented election in the riverine area. “As our people (electoral officers) were coming into the community after crossing the river, they seized them and the materials and burnt all the materials.” “They chased our people away and seized some but the military rescued them.” Mr Orji, who is originally the REC for Anambra State, spoke in Otuoke (Ward 13 of Ogbia LGA) where President Goodluck Jonathan and his family voted.
