When we talk of the movie industry in Nigeria, Nollywood automatically comes to mind. But there have been questions as to what constitutes Nollywood. While the southern part of the country , either the Igbo-language movie industry or Yoruba-language industry and even the English-speaking industry have conveniently come to be called Nollywood,  but the northern movie industry has distinguished itself as a separate movie industry which is called Kannywood, with the base in Kano. Nollywood, of course is the heart and soul of the Nigerian movie industry and Kannywood may be seen as the appendage, but one which has grown from strength to strength with no less razzmatazz and fortune. Kannywood may not be able to match Nollywood pound for pound, in glitz and glamour, but the Hausa-language movie industry has its own bragging rights. In this piece, Saturday Quickie gives you a quickie glimpse of the beauties ruling the cinema screens up north and they are as beautiful and captivating as their southern colleagues. Here are 10 of the most beautiful and most talented.
