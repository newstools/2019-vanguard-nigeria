Only her mother came to meet me and that was after he got my daughter pregnant. I gave the baby the insecticide to drink because of my financial problems. I don’t have money to take care of the baby and her mother. I was even the one that gave her money when she was going to the clinic. I gave her money twice for medical bills and since I didn’t have money to give her again, I couldn’t be going to beg on the streets” When asked how she feels about everything that happened said everything belongs to God and no human being can run faster than their destiny and she didn’t know it was wrong until after she killed the baby.
