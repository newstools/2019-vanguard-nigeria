Commenting on the result, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Eddie Efekoha, said that the unwavering support of the board and management of the company was pivotal to the success being recorded. He said: “The strong performance reflects the board and management’s commitment towards rewarding our shareholders with good returns.
