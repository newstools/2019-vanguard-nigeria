By Funmi Ajumobi HELLO lovely kids out there! Do you know that being different from others means that you are special? Being taller, shorter, and fatter or thinner than most of your friends and classmates, being physically challenged or being an Albino should not give you sleepless nights or make you unhappy because you are unique. The way God created you is what makes you who you are. What if everyone you knew looked, talked, dressed, and acted the same way you do? Then life will be boring! It is what you have that others do not have that makes you a unique person. Just look at yourself, no matter what you feel before, and then tell yourself, ‘I am unique and special just as my Creator wants me to be’. Remember that the world needs people like you to make it colourful and distinctive. As you prepare to go on Easter holidays, be your parents or guardians friends. Let them know what is happening to you. There is no secret that should be kept from them. If anyone tells you that, know that it is dangerous for you. Have a fun filled Easter holiday ahead of you
