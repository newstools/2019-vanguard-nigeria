PhD programmes are preparing the next generation of researchers in both academic and business fields. Because of the importance of research, a disciplined approach and guidance are required to drive intellectual search. A Doctorate of Philosophy programme is a training ground for developing that discipline and unique approach to intellectual search and solutions. The desire to contribute significantly to the progress of society and also to a subject matter has been the primary purpose for Doctorate of Philosophy. Invariably, personal and career growth are inclusive and extensively enhanced in the course of a doctorate research work. PhD is a globally recognised postgraduate academic degree, awarded by universities and higher education institutions to a candidate who has fulfilled all course credits requirements and has submitted a thesis or dissertation. And this will be based on extensive and original research in their chosen fields. The programme prepares candidates to engage in extensive research and publish this research work. The highest academic degree awarded by any institutions of higher learning is PhD. As a PhD graduate, you should be able to excel in various institutional settings and other establishments where your expertise is needed. The culture of PhD is research-driven, and those who do the research are the custodians of actionable knowledge, and therefore drivers of change. A doctorate degree programme empowers students with the ability to identify problems and use the results of past attempts to find solutions. Also, to use abstract analysis like models, big-data and technology to make a powerful argument in preferring solutions to research problems. PhD programmes also support the development of generic skills which equip you to operate successfully as a professional researcher in any setting. Of course, the original concept of a PhD is the creation of new knowledge. Being a researcher means uncovering facts, developing new ideas and improving understanding through the creation of knowledge. To some degree, the work and ideas of others will form the foundation upon which your research work is built. Upon completion, you should be able to make an original contribution to knowledge in your discipline. For those in the academic sector, a PhD is perhaps the most valuable asset that an academician can have. Not only does it help to improve your ability to understand and solve problems, but it also helps to increase your confidence. You will become able to articulate and communicate your ideas and findings through publishable dissertations. It is a path that can lead to the publishing of papers, receiving grants and other recognitions for your work. You can also get deals from big research organisations and multinationals to join their workforce either as a consultant or full-time employee. Also, Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) is a must for academicians who desire to rise to the pinnacle of their teaching professions. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1247016" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=640%2C428&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=58%2C39&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=260%2C174&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=195%2C130&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=115%2C77&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Unicaf-University2.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> A Doctorate of Philosophy tremendously advances personal development. Because of the expansive amount of research required in doctorate research, and limited time, skills such as time management, project management, persistence, perseverance among others are developed. The skills acquired during a doctoral programme can be used by you in your personal activities and those around you. Upon completing a PhD, you become more articulated as a person and sound in mind. You will be able to critically assess and analyse a large amount of information. You can solve more day-to-day problems as a PhD graduate. Acquired skills and knowledge during your research work as a doctoral student are transferrable to those around you. This could be your work colleagues, research colleagues, friends and relatives. For instance, a PhD student in the oil and gas field could task his subordinates at work or even his students to adopt his research techniques and methodologies in solving similar problems. Of course, this is the fundamental aspect of a doctorate degree in philosophy. PhD programmes are often more specialised. In some cases, a PhD programme could be generic. While this may be so, for generic PhD programmes, researchers are still advised to specialise in an area of research. Therefore, a PhD programme helps students to become a specialist in a given subject matter. They become an authority of knowledge in that area of their speciality. PhD programmes contribute immensely to societies and bring social change. It helps to set the pace for growth and social advancement through networking and social collaborations by researchers. This is fondly part of the process of doctorate degree programmes. Researchers for the programme come together to share useful experiences and knowledge. These experiences and knowledge can become fully explored by these candidates. In return, it could help shape a new behavioural pattern and bring social change. The benefits of a Doctorate degree in philosophy are numerous to mention but a few.
