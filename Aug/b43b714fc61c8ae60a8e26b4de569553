A source in the club said that Temitope Bolus, former Coach of Giwa FC of Jos, remained a strong favourite for the job. The source also said Bolus, a former assistant to Imama Amakpakabo in Rangers International FC of Enugu, was considered to have capacity to carry on with the legacy Ilechukwu had left behind. “Bolus is a good coach and I think he is the right man to take over from Ilechukwu. The technical crew of the club knows what is best for the club and is prepared to act accordingly. “By the time the club announces the new coach, Bolus will surely get the nod,’’ the source said. Also, Olawale Quadri, the club’s Media Officer, said the club would not allow a vacuum to be created by the departure of its longest serving coach. “The board is working round the clock to re-position the club. We are not leaving any stone unturned as we have a legacy of good football artistry and we will continue in that fashion,’’ he said.
