Super Eagles assistant coach, Imama Amapakabo has said that Alex Iwobi has the potential to become a key figure for Premier League side Everton. The 23-year-old joined the Toffees on a five-year deal from Arsenal for a fee of an initial £28million deal – which could rise to £34m with add-ons. Iwobi has yet to make his debut for Everton (he remained on the bench for the duration of the win over Watford at Goodison Park this past weekend) but he should see regular playing time for the Merseyside club.
