This much was made known to journalists at the weekend by the General Manager of the team, Musa Adamu when asked about the team’s plan for the FIBA 2019 World Cup in China. “I cannot tell you exactly when the team is leaving for China, the basketball federation has been doing a lot for this team.

The former Nigerian international revealed that despite plans to adequately prepare the team for the apex global sports fiesta, the unavailability of funds might just be the clog in the wheel of the team’s preparation.- “The team is here in Nigeria, so we hope that they will act because we don’t know when we will leave.
