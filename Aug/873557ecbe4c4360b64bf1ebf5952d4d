YENAGOA—THE Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja has directed the Bayelsa State Election Petition Tribunal to immediately resume trial on the petition  by All Progressives Congress, APC, and its candidate for Bayelsa Central senatorial district in the 2019 general election, Mr. Festus Daumiebi. It will be recalled that the APC candidate petition had earlier been dismissed by the tribunal on technical grounds. Dissatisfied with the ruling of the tribunal, APC and its candidate appealed to the Court of Appeal, praying it to set aside the ruling of the tribunal and mandate it to re-try the petition on its merits.
