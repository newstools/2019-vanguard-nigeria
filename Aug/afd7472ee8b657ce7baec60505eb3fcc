He said the casualty was  usually soft target, innocent victims and aids workers, saying the day was a sober reflection to remember the humanitarians who lost their lives in the line of duty. “The humanitarian community lost over 35 aids workers, majority are local actors, who sacrifice their comfort and life for others to live. “We are urging security agencies to enhance security arrangement that will ensure that local actors are supported in reaching out to the affected population.

The Programme Director, Participating Communication for Gender Development Initiative (PAGED), Ms Ummi Bukar, who received an award as a woman humanitarian, encouraged women not to be tired in their relentless efforts. She, however, said she would continue to create the platform to mainstream gender, particularly the voices of women, saying that conflicts and other forms of violence had changed gender roles, bringing more burden and responsibility upon women. “Women shield men from attacks, most times when terrorist attacks, the women disguise the men and hide them, so they won’t be killed. “Also during this periods of attack women are left to cater for the needs of their children alone,” she said.
