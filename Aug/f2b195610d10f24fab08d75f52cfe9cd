He said the fake news circulating on social media platforms was the handiwork of the enemies of the State. “Our attention has been drawn to some gory pictures on social media platforms, purporting that some herdsmen attacked a popular motor park in Lokoja and killed all passengers found there. “We wish to allay the fears of commuters and residents of the State that nothing like that ever happened as all motor parks in the state remain peaceful. Our security operatives are also ensuring the security of lives and property in the State. “It is instructive to note that the intent of the promoters of such fake news was to create panic in the state for political reasons.

Fanwo thanked Kogites for partnering with the Government to protect the most “central state in Nigeria”. VANGUARD
