Atanda said: “It is high time traditional rulers stop running to politicians for personal benefit, many of our monarchs have reduced themselves to political sycophants because of contracts and other favours from politicians, so they lost the right to call any erring politician in public office to order”. “Meanwhile, traditional rulers ought to be living above board morally so that any of their subjects would be put under control.” Earlier, the supervisor for the Ministry of Home, Tourism and Culture, Dr Bisi Babawale, who represented Governor Adegboyega Oyetola disclosed that government intention is to use tradition to develop the state tourism sector and attract foreign investment to the state. He said many traditional religion followers at home and in the diaspora have the potential to attract foreign investment if the cultural aspect of African tradition is properly harnessed.
