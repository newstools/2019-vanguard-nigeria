Attah urged the public and travellers who utilize the route to go about their businesses without apprehension, stressing ‘’those with legitimate engagements should have nothing to be afraid of.’’ He explained that the security agencies in the country came together to form a bond and deploy a common response strategy to tackle insecurity in the area. “Our attention was drawn to what happened at the Seme Border on Wednesday due to a slight misconception but it was immediately resolved. “Whoever has valid document is free to come into the country but those without legitimate documents will not be allowed into our country. “The initial take off of the joint security exercise commenced on Tuesday afternoon. For people to see increased security operatives at the border, it is normal that there could be a misconception,’’ he said. Attah also said the joint exercise was timely because of security challenges such as terrorism, importation of illegal arms, and increased illegal migration. He further said that the security operatives were committed and determined to face security challenges around the border areas head-on.
