Nigerian Labour Congress, Kogi State chapter has said about N2.8b was needed to offset the arrears of workers’ salary in the state. State chairman of the labour union, Mr  Onuh Edoka, who is also the National Vice President of Medical and Health Workers Union, MHWUN, stated this yesterday in Lokoja  at the 14th Edition of North Central Zonal Conference of the union. According to him, “The state government was yet to release the 10% of the fund kept aside to offset arrears of state workers’  salary. We must appreciate the state government over the bailout. The bailout was effectively used by government. Any one who harbour contrary opinion should engage the government personally.

When that is done, we shall come out to make a definite statement. “We have computed those months when percentage were paid. What is needed now to offset all arrears of state workers who are on the clear list is N2.8 billion.”Edoka however frowned at some aides of the governor who are sabotaging the complete payment of salary to council workers.
