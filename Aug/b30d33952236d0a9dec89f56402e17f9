The affected leaders were at the private residence of the president in Daura, Katsina state, as part of Eid El-Kabir celebration. The President said he was convinced that majority of Nigerians understand who he was and his mission, on account of which they returned him for a second term in office with larger margin of votes than in 2015. “You know how much I laboured to get here. I ran three times in the past. The fourth time, God used technology to do it for me. ”The fifth time I ran (Feb. 23, 2019), I went to all the states of the federation. The turnout of crowds was overwhelming.

This is what the votes showed. “The administration will dwell on our campaign issues — security, economy and corruption. We will fight for the poor,” he said. He emphasised the important place of agriculture under his administration, promising to appoint a minister ”who is knowledgeable and will know how to promote interest and investment in the sector.” The president said: “I will appoint a minister who knows agriculture and its role in providing jobs and growing our economy. You have seen how we broke the fertiliser jinx in the country. ”We will do more to better the lots of our farmers. Agriculture is our strength.” President Buhari expressed delight with the changing attitude of young people to agriculture, with many earning respectable incomes, urging all of those without regular incomes to return to the farm. In his remarks, Malam Yusuf Mai’ Aduwa, one the leaders of the delegation, thanked Nigerians for giving the President a second mandate to lead the country, stressing that he would not let the country down. Mohammed Saleh, another community leader, said the communities under the Daura Emirate were grateful to the President for signing a bill to establish a Federal Polytechnic in Daura. He noted that this came after they had complained that the area needed a tertiary institution to encourage the youth to pursue higher education.
