How can there be good governance when Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world? In all these, government had not done anything. Those that commit these atrocities against Nigeria, God will judge them.” The former Minister added that the continued detention of Leah Sharibu and others by Boko Haram would remain a “spiritual wound” in the life of APC administration until they are freed by the government. He further urged Nigerians particularly Christians to unite and work together irrespective of their denomination.

I am fed up with people who said we should say nothing and do nothing. With the way Nigerians are being killed, Christians have a duty to stand up and resist evil that it may flee. We must fight for the weak and speak truth to power. Vanguard
