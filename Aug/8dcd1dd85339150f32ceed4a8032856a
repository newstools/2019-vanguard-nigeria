She said,”Plus sized ladies should know that they are capable of anything they set their minds on, irrespective of their body sizes. You shouldn’t let anybody make you feel less human or less important because you are a true representation of an African Woman. I appreciate Cherdah Republic for the opportunity they have given me this year and wish to see more ladies embrace this platform and experience the positives I have benefitted from being here”.
