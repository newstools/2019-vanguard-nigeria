Sixteen-year-old Ansu Fati became Barcelona’s youngest ever La Liga goalscorer on Saturday but could not prevent his side stumbling to a surprise 2-2 draw at promoted Osasuna. The result left the champions with only four points after three games. Roberto Torres’ thumping volley gave Osasuna the lead in the seventh minute to send the boisterous El Sadar crowd into a frenzy. Barca struggled to cope with the home side in a first half in which they failed to have a single shot at goal.

Barca took the lead in the 64th minute through a superb strike into the bottom corner from Arthur Melo.
