A Frenchman working for Banro was kidnapped in March 2017 but later freed. The company stopped operations at a third mine in 2017 after a deadly attack. The Mai-Mai are self-described “self-defence” groups who were armed during the Second Congo War (1998-2003) by the authorities in the distant capital Kinshasa to help combat invading Ugandans and Rwandans. But many of the militiamen kept their weapons after the war, and fighting between the groups and the Congolese army continues both in North and South Kivu. Vanguard
