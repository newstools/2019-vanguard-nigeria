Ex-aide to former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, Pastor Reno Omokri has reacted to some events that made headlines on newspapers. Below are his opinions: Just look at that! 3 days ago, a Katsina bandit revealed on @MobilePunch that they get armed by helicopters who drop weapons for them. Now Kidnapper, Wadume, exposes @APC as his sponsors. The truth is unraveling. We are back in Abacha days! #ACabinetOfCorruptionGoldMedalists pic.twitter.com/pkolojBBcR — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 24, 2019  This is Wadume, the kidnapper and killer of policemen. He is seen here with the @OfficialAPCNg Guber candidate for Taraba, Sani Danladi. Can you imagine what General @MBuhari and Bola @AsiwajuTinubu would have done if Evans was romancing the PDP?#APCIsWadumeAndWadumeIsAPC pic.twitter.com/xkeBTOnsaZ — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 24, 2019  General @MBuhari wrote an article in the @washingtonpost calling for an end to SLAVERY. What a HYPOCRITE. This is a man who refuses to pay Nigerian workers the ₦30k minimum wage making them endure SLAVE WAGES of ₦18k#ACabinetOfCorruptionGoldMedalistshttps://t.co/JQo8S1OhzC — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 24, 2019  Watch this video from Aljazeera, @AJEnglish, ‘nowhere is safe from kidnapping in Nigeria’. This is what General @MBuhari has reduced Nigeria to. He promised to fight insecurity, but Nigeria is now more insecure than at anytime in her history #ACabinetOfCorruptionGoldMedalists pic.twitter.com/qZb7vrTlAS — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 24, 2019  New #RenoMoni ₦10k giveaway To QUALIFY, RETWEET this and answer the question or be DISQUALIFIED Mention the handle of General @MBuhari‘s Minister who is a CLOSE FRIEND of #3 on @FBI‘s list of 77 SCAMMERS Include name and account#RenoMoni REAL #TraderMoni FAKE #OsinbajoFraud — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 24, 2019  Watch @CNN‘s breakdown of @FBI‘s massive arrest of 77 Nigerians for fraud.

In 2015, General @MBuhari appointed an ex Chief of Army Staff as interior minister. The General failed to bring internal security. So Buhari replaced the General with this man!#ACabinetOfCorruptionGoldMedalists pic.twitter.com/U59FPt9Kt3 — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 23, 2019  Who is the real @NGRPresident?

Let’s not make this thing a tribal thing. What they allegedly did is bad. $1.1 billion is no joke. But just one man, Abacha, stole over $5 billion and General @MBuhari defended him and these 2 men! #RenosDarts pic.twitter.com/Zx6jybz1Ak — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) August 23, 2019  You call for the heads of Igbos because of FBI’s list.
