But he never came back. “Rather, I got a call from someone, who asked where I was. I told the person I was in the shop. The caller asked where was my husband? I told her he had gone to work. She said I should call my husband to know where he was, that she had unpleasant information. I called my husband’s telephone number, but the line didn’t go through. “Almost immediately, I heard another person making calls in front of my shop. I heard the caller asking the person at the other end if it was that man that rented chairs. At that point, I became scared. I rushed outside and held the man by the shirt, asking what happened. He said we should go to the house. By the time I got home, I met my husband on the ground, dead. “My husband left me with four children. Tell me, where do I start from? He had great dream for their education. He assured them that he would give them the best of education within his financial limit. He was a quiet and easygoing man.” At this point, her children— Abeeb, 12; Basita, nine; Basit, six, and Alim two, held their mother, weeping.
