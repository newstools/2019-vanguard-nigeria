It is an auspicious occasion that allows the subjects to have an audience with their monarch who by tradition, is restricted from regular public appearance, as the exalted office demands that he lives in ceremonial seclusion for most part of the year. The 709-year-old edition took place from 10th August till the 25th of August 2019. The La Casera team had earlier paid a courtesy visit to the paramount ruler of Ado Kingdom, His Royal Majesty, Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe Aladesanmi III (CON, JP), the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti to felicitate with him and the Ado-Ekiti People. Kolanuts were broken and prayers said for the peace and prosperity of the community. The next stop for La Casera was the brand sponsored Ewi Cup Football Final, followed by the Udiroko Street Activation and Sampling Day, which took place before the festival’s grand finale. The La Casera train toured the beautiful city of Ado-Ekiti, leaving behind a trail of merriment, dance and invigorating apple goodness.
