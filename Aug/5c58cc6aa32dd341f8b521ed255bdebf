Several thousand people protested on Thursday outside the Indian embassy in London against the country’s move to strip the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir of its autonomy. The protesters held up signs reading “Kashmir is bleeding” and waved Kashmiri and Pakistani flags. Police separated them from a smaller pro-Indian counter-demonstration.
