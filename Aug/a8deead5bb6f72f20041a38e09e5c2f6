She will return his dowry to him, “he ruled. Zailani, who resides in Gandarko village, Kaduna State, earlier told the court that Yakubu abandoned her when she was ill and pregnant. She told the court that she spent eight months in her parent’s house with no news from her husband until she had a miscarriage. She prayed the court to dissolve the marriage. On his part, Yakubu, who resides in Kabobo village, Kaduna, denied the claims, saying that his wife told him she was going home to get spiritual help. He had prayed the court to give him time to reconcile with the wife, saying he still loved her. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the court had ordered the complainant to present witness after efforts to reconcile the couple proved abortive. The witnesses she presented confirmed that Zailani was abandoned by her husband when she was ill. Vanguard
