Look for clothing with high cotton content. For instance, white will show more sweat, but it won’t be very visible on other colours or on prints or patterns. For men, wearing an under shirt can help soak up some of the sweat. Women could wear an absorbent camisole top or dress shields. Choose clothes with a loose weave, such as linens. Avoid silk because it makes you feel hotter. Pocket a handkerchief.
