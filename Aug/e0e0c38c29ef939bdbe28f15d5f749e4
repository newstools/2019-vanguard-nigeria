Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers State, and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has queried the immediate past senator representing Rivers South-East, Sen. Magnus Abe on what he described as “showing early signs of apprehension for the forthcoming congresses of the APC in Rivers State”<img class="size-full wp-image-1119845 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rotimi-Ameachi-e1546192506407.png?resize=412%2C348&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="412" height="348" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The minister in a swift reaction expressed surprise that Abe would resort to unguarded language to express his indisposition and fear for congresses even when he (Amaechi) did not give date and time of congresses to his supporters. “I addressed my supporters to go home and prepare for congresses, I didn’t give them any date and time, and those are the responsibility of the national secretariat. “Senator Magnus Abe has no reason to be afraid of congress; he should tell his supporters to also prepare for congresses of the party in the State since he says he is very popular. A popular politician should be very happy anytime congress is on the table,” Amaechi declared. Blame politicians for electoral violence, not INEC – Sen Abe(Opens in a new browser tab) The Minister declined to respond to sundry comments made by Abe in his statement saying such were obvious signs of frustration on the part of the former senator. The minister was reacting to a statement in which the former senator kicked against the holding of congresses of APC in Rivers State. In that statement, Abe resorted to name calling and uncouth language to describe the planned congresses announced by the Minister to his supporters. It would be recalled that Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi had announced to his supporters during the reception in Abuja that followed his inauguration as a second term minister that they (supporters) should begin to prepare themselves for congresses as part of rebuilding and re-positioning the party in Rivers State. However, a few days after, Sen. Abe, while addressing his supporters in Port Harcourt, in an inexplicable outburst of emotions, questioned why the minister should ask his supporters to go home and prepare for congresses.

Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi has accused the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike and the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator, representing Rivers South-East in the Senate, Magnus Abe of conniving to defame him.
