He said: “For every project we feature on the site, we also have in place a strict vetting process carried out by our in-house team and partners like Nachtwey Advisory Services Limited, a SEC registered Asset Management Company, Emerging Africa Capital Group, a licensed Trustee firm, and AXA Mansard, a trusted insurance company. “Since investing in real estate can be a capital intensive project for many, Vistafront  was established to give people the opportunity to fund real estate projects from the comfort of their mobile devices and earn good profit at the end of the project cycle, Ajuwon said.
