JUST LANDED IN NIGERIA LAST YEAR – THE MOST POWERFUL SOLUTION FOR ANY KIND OF EYE AND EYE ISSUE. <img class="wp-image-203 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/getcare.name.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="169" data-recalc-dims="1" /> This Is The Genuine Total Treatment For Any Type Of Eye Problem “Let Me Share With You The *Pill* I Used To Treat My Eyes Problem” …Dropping  My Glasses Permanently! “Doctors Predicted I Would Never Cure My Glaucoma & Cataract… But Contrary To His Prediction, I Cured It Permanently and Naturally In Just 3 Months! I’ll Show You How…” My name is Daniel Solomon, …and the first thing you should know about me is, I am not a doctor.  I’m not an expert on nutrition either. I never went to medical college and I don’t have any certificate in anything except that which I obtained in my marine field. But aside my job, the other thing I consider myself an “expert” about is… I know… because… I CONQUERED it.  Before I continue, I want to be VERY honest with you… I’m serious. You see, you are going to want…really want…the scientific breakthrough described on this page…and…if you can’t afford it, you are probably going to be sick to your stomach. On the other hand, if you are one who is somewhat financially secure…and…you would like to Reverse  Glaucoma, Myopia, Cataract,  …and other serious conditions, and at the same time restore your vision without expensive and harmful surgery…no matter what your age… then this is going to be the most exciting message you will ever read. Anyway, here is what I am writing to tell you… The Big Drug Companies Are Cheating Everyone In NIGERIA Who Is Trying To Regain Lost Sight!  They do this in two different ways. First of all, they try to keep us from finding out about safe, cheap ways to Reverse Glaucoma, cataracts, myopia and other eyes problems… without… going for surgery. The second way they cheat us is, they sell us millions and millions of naira’ worth of prescription Glasses/lens that are long lasting and proffer no immediate solution. Not only that, many of these glasses are very dangerous, …and they create a sort of refractive errors to our cornea. As you may or may not know, “Research Has Proven That Wearing Lenses And Contacts Will  Destroy Your Vision Over Time…” I’m not just saying this to scare you. It’s a fact you need to know. Scientific journals have published multiple claims that wearing corrective minus lenses really does make your eyesight worse: Of course, Dr. Bates realized this over 90 years ago… when he quotes… …“If glasses are worn continuously over time the poor vision will generally become worse. Essentially what glasses do is lock the eyes into their refractive state and in order to see through your lenses you have to maintain the poor vision that the lenses are designed to correct.” Wm H Bates: Perfect Sight Without Glasses 1920 “The use of compensatory lenses (glasses and contacts) to treat or neutralize the symptoms does not correct the problem. The current education and training of eye care practitioners discourages preventive and remedial treatment.” Gottlieb, 1982. Journal of Optometry and Visual Development. Well, I don’t blame him anyway, it was never his fault…. But before I tell you exactly how I got to surprise everyone with my results (which am about to reveal to you right here), let me tell you my sad story… When I was 15 years old I started having difficulty seeing what my teacher wrote on the blackboard in school. My mother took me for an eye exam and I was diagnosed as being nearsighted. “You’re going to need glasses…” my optometrist said. I was horrified by this news since I thought they would make me look ugly and that other kids would make fun of me. My prescription then was (as you may guess) -0.5. My eyesight got steadily worse and I required higher prescription almost every year. My glasses kept getting thicker (as thick as the bottom of the old coca-cola bottle). And over time I also developed astigmatism. My eyesight was deteriorating, and so was my self esteem. I thought I would be chained to glasses for life. I still remembered the dreadful day when my school optometrist passed the verdict that I am nearsighted and would need to wear glasses for my life. You see, I was an introvert and overweight kid. Wearing those ugly goldfish bowl type glasses wasn’t helping my limited self esteem. Nicknames such as four-eyed frog began to surface in my little world. Inevitably, my eyesight worsened over the years. From 20/100, it proceeded to 20/400… I felt like a helpless cripple whenever I was without my glasses. The world appeared in a fuzzy blur and looked pretty intimidating. I didn’t know it at the time, but wearing glasses did nothing to improve my natural vision. They were a crutch – an artificial fix. And worse, they actually made my vision deteriorate even more because the lens power actually increased the near point stress I put my eyes under. As of May 2017, I had a visual prescription of 20/400 on my left and 20/250 on my right eye. This means that my left eye can only see things at 20 feet where else eyesight-healthy people can see at 400 feet. In short, I won’t be able to see your face clearly even if you are just 20 feet right in front of me. It was increasingly difficult to navigate my life. Where a normal person would see two headlights coming from a car at night, I would see perhaps eighteen. I couldn’t read my computer with my nose against the screen. I couldn’t recognize my youngest son’s face from across a small room. Couldn’t read a book, couldn’t watch a movie and couldn’t even see my phone Qwerty keyboard  unless I put my spectacles on. For much of last year I’ve been traveling with a seeing-eye (my junior brother). He’s been helping me cross streets like an old Man, and making sure I don’t use the lady’s room instead of the Gent rest room. My eyesight problem was that terrible! . . . I never would have imagined that my bad eye-sight would ruined my career. I did everything I could to prepare myself to become an officer. I played sports, was involved in student council, and volunteered in extra-curricular activities whenever i could. I went to college, got good grades, and stayed in shape. In early 2018 I went to a reputable clinic to undergo LASIK. Regrettably, my surgery did not provide me with the results I hoped for. At first my vision did seem clear, but within 3 months after surgery I found myself squinting a lot. I went to get my eyes checked and was saddened to find out that I yet again had a prescription of -0.5 as well as Glaucoma and cataract combined. Unfortunately I also developed side effects of glare around bright lights (night driving became difficult) as well as eye dryness for which I had to use eye drops every day. My doctors offered to do another surgery but I refused not wishing to cause any more harm to my eyes. I also did not wish to wear glasses since I knew they would likely cause my vision to steadily get worse. “Your eyes need,” said my doctor, “Immediate surgery.” And I can’t guarantee if it will become successful. My heart raced. I leaned forward and turned my head to see him with my good eye. “Tell me more,” I said softly. My doctor told me that a hospital in Canada was recruiting patients for a study of acute optic neuritis and that I might qualify. I had to decide quickly. I knew that any kind of treatment had to start within five to seven days of the onset of vision loss. Twenty-four hours had already elapsed. One internal voice battled with another: “Don’t be stupid and try something that is never going to work. You will be disappointed like so many others that have been diagnosed with your problem.” But another, louder, voice asked, “What is the harm in trying?” With great anticipation and anxiety, I finally said, “Yes, I want to be considered.” Immediately, He drove me to his study center. Signed some medical documents and handed them over to me. Take it with you, he said …and give it to whosoever that will be in charge of your second surgery in abroad. While undergoing the trauma of losing and gaining sight, I felt overcome by desperation, …and to secure my job, I was pushed to seek solution beyond the shores of NIGERIA. It was an emergency and i couldn’t get to gather enough money for the surgery. So, I obtained a loan from a micro finance bank so as to get my eyes (especially the left eye) operated abroad. Two days later, after some serious heartfelt prayers by my love ones and well wishers  (…my parents, wife, two kids and my younger brother) escorted me down to the airport . (my mum is a dedicated prayer warrior, though). At the airport, she insisted we say yet another prayer before I took off. We hold our hands together in that open space and not minding what others might think of us. After the prayer, I hugged each and every one of them. As I was leaving, I turned to look if they were gone, but they were still there waving in tears. I couldn’t help it… I began to sob uncontrollably, looked at my newly wedded dear wife, then I ran back and hugged her so tightly and whisper into her ears that I’m so sorry for the pains I’ve caused her in our early relationship life. However, though, my final hope was in GOD. but I thought I didn’t deserve his mercy because I  turn to him only when I needed help or when all doors are closed. I felt ashame to even utter a word of  prayer, but I still have to… anyways. …It occurs to me I would never be able to repair my eyes – no matter what i do, because I have already done everything humanly possible (met with the best doctors, did eye surgery twice, bought the most expensive prescribed drugs and what have you…) but no avail. So, I gave up… And I carried on with my life… It had happened many times before, but somehow this time it seemed like the last straw. I did know where to turn or what else to try. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want this to sound like a sob story. I’m not telling you all this because I want you to feel sorry for me. There’s no need for that anyway. My story has a very happy ending. My story has a happy ending because the very next couple month I made a discovery that has changed my entire life. I found an amazingly way to regained my lost sight that I never dreamed existed. I will everly stay loyal and grateful to Mr. Kofi, a Ghanaian expert at my work place, Ilupeju, Lagos. He was also a four eyed man in the past suffering from glaucoma and had his wife struggling with Macular degeneration. He Overheard me complaining of my terrible eye situation to another colleague and decided to ask what I have done to improve it. I was blunt with him, telling him my situation had no cure and that I had tried everything possible to no avail. He laughed, quickly opened his briefcase to show me an old test card showing he had struggled with bad eye vision  for over 15 years. “But where is your glasses sir?” I asked curiously. He simply smiled and told me to meet him at his office later that day. …It was an appointment that changed my life forever. At this point, I couldn’t wait any longer, I was curious to know exactly what it took Mr. Kofi to finally do away with his glasses and see freely again. I was so hungry for what he had to tell me that I was checking on him every 15 minutes to see if he was free, as he was a senior staff. Then at about 3.00pm, he sent for me! I was nervous as he sat me down, and started revealing hard known secret of improving you bad eyes Naturally using plant extract combinations. I was thrilled by the discoveries but still confused on where exactly to start. Mr. Kofi asked me to return the next day and get a free gift from him. That gift has been my best gift from anyone till date. I was handed over 3 bottles of a specially made herbal capsule containing all these herbal extracts and was instructed on how to use it. I followed it religiously for four weeks straight and my joy knew no bounds. By the seventh week, I could see comfortable without my glasses and didn’t have to worry about carrying it or not. Because my situation was a bit severe, It took me over 9 weeks to finally feel the full effect of my treatment. To me, I was weeping internally because , I didn’t know how I would get more bottles and complete my treatment when the first three gift I got finished. But Mr. Kofi is the best man I have met till date, he gave me a number of someone I could buy these product abroad and even get it into Nigeria. Though it was a bit costly, I didn’t mind because I was seeing results I didn’t see in years of visiting my optometrist. To further authenticate the effectiveness of this solution, I went to my eye doctor — who wears Spectacle himself. And he confirmed my eye is 100% better than before. He couldn’t believe that I improved my eyesight naturally. My Doctor had to even get the same remedy from me for one of his patient… which he used to get rid of his spectacle. And he apologized for ever doubting herbal solutions for my eye problems. I have since gone on to ‘cure’ both my parents and my brother of their Short Sightedness. NO MORE WEARING OF SPECTACLE NO NEED OF USING ANY EYE DROPS GLAUCOMA WAS TREATED FOR GOOD CATARACT DISAPPEARED WITHIN 90 DAYS. You see, I thought of how to help others suffering with these eye problem; So, i decided to Contact the company to buy more so I can send to people with whatever eye problem. That’s when I created this page to help others. And that is why I recently imported 400 bottles each of this Irresistible solution.
