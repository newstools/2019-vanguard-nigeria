Confirming the development, the President-General of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, MWUN, Comrade Adewale Adeyanju, told Vanguard Maritime Report, that the IOCs are about 40 per cent compliant to the directive adding that with time the situation will improve. Adeyanju said that the IOCs have shown commitment adding that it is the hope of the stakeholders that the commitment will be sustained.

Sunmola also said that some stevedores are being processed for registration adding, however, that the number of registered stevedoring contractors has not been impressive. Engagement of dockworkers Recall that the Maritime Workers Union said, a few months ago, that they were embarking on a strike to demand for the engagement of government-appointed stevedores and payment of all outstanding wages of the dockworkers. The strike action which had the ports shut down for two days was to compel the IOCs operating in the country to pay wages owed dockworkers and stevedoring companies. According to Adeyanju, the IOCs had refused to engage the Union on the issue, thereby leaving it with no option than to commence the strike. Vanguard
