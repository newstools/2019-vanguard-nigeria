Nnamdi Kanu, Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB,on Sunday, described the attack on the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, in Nuremberg Germany as a ‘courageous act’ and ‘polite warning’. Reacting in his official Twitter page, said: “the courageous act by IPOB at Nürnberg Germany is a polite warning to those engaged in selling our collective interest to Fulani caliphate. Nwodo, Igbo governors are warned.” Ike Ekweremadu was mobbed by Nigerians (mostly Ibos) in Germany not IPOB. “You’ve come to celebrate New yam festival here while herdsmen are killing Farmers in Nigeria”. This is just the beginning of the Revolution because we all are tired. #RevolutionIsNow pic.twitter.com/AF7n6knQEj — Hon.

Genocide Exhibition & stating the obvious that Biafra was never an Igbo only affair. History will judge murderers of millions of innocent Biafrans.#BiafraGenocide pic.twitter.com/jhg81umAgl — Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (@MaziNnamdiKanu) August 17, 2019  Fulani tyranny & primitive dictatorship will never win this war against the massed ranks of oppressed people in Nigeria. Suppressing the right to protest in a so-called democracy will only hasten the collapse of that ZOO.#FreeSowore & allow the #RevolutionNow right to protest. pic.twitter.com/ZzjrSWosY7 — Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (@MaziNnamdiKanu) August 3, 2019  Ekweremadu was physically assaulted by some members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, in Nuremberg, Germany, on Saturday.
