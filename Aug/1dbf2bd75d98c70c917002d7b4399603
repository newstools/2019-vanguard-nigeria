Abakaliki—THE Biafra Independence Movement, BIM, yesterday, raised the alarm over the incessant arrests and detention of its members by security agencies in the state. Ebonyi Central  BIM leader, Chief Oseh Sylvester, who stated that he was worried over the development, wondered why  members of a non-violent movement or organisation could be made to pass through such level of persecution and total injustice in the state.

Sylvester said: “ BIM is not happy with the recent mass arrest of our members in different parts of the state even though some of them were released. “We are a non-violent group as we respect constituted law  and order. Our peaceful disposition should not be relegated to the background.” Vanguard
