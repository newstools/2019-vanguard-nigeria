Owerri—A Catholic priest and the Spiritual Director of Catholic Adoration Family, Owerri Archdiocese, Reverend Father Cammymario Egeolu, has called on Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State to listen to good advice if he wants to succeed. Egeolu, while speaking in Owerri, said he wanted Ihedioha to succeed as governor as well as avoid mistakes made by his predecessors, but warned him that recycling of old politicians was not the best for him. The cleric was of the view that there should be more of young people in Ihedioha’s administration, while he should establish an advisory board for his party leaders, where he meets with them from time to time to seek their advice on issues of governance.

I am not saying that he should not use them, but he can fix them at the advisory board and meet them periodically to get some advice on how he can govern the state better. “Or when will the younger ones have the much-talked-about experience?“ Vanguard There is no doubt that Governor Rochas Okorocha was a direct beneficiary of the face off between the Catholic Church and Chief Ikedi Ohakim, ahead of the 2011 general elections.
