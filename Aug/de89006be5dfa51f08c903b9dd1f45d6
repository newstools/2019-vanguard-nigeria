Going down memory lane, she recalled how her aunt once made her take a vow using the Bible to stay away from sex until marriage. She however, stated that she would give up on her vow if she meets a man she truly loves.

She told us that one thing that kept her was that she made a vow with God to stay pure, after which she now made us make a vow using the Bible to stay pure till marriage. At 23, I could wait or find someone to confuse my head and I will give it out,” she said. Recall that evicted housemate, Nelson once admitted to pushing for a relationship with Diane. Nelson said he stopped gunning for a relationship with Diane after Tuoyo told him he had an interest in her. Vanguard
