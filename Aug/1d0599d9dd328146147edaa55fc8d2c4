She went to the agent on the 24th July and the agent asked that she should fill a form and get a guarantor and also fill in his phone number and name. Because she had a plan, she filled the form with a fake name and she attached a fake passport on the form. She identified herself as Esther whereas she is known as Franker. On the 25th July, which was the next day, she was taken to the house of one Mrs. Taiye, at Masha, Surulere, to work as a house help and she was offered to be paid N20,000. Incidentally, a sister to the woman who she was going to work with was to return to the country from oversee on that same day and she followed her new boss to the airport to pick up her sister. When they got home, the house help entered the room where her boss’s sister’s bags were kept, opened them and stole all the foreign currencies which include, $2800, 1000 pounds and 200 Dutch guilder and she left the house immediately. When the security man at the gate tried to stop her she told him that she had problems with the madam but as the security man tried to confirm from their madam what was happening she took a bike and zoomed off. She ran to Ajah to meet one of her friends and threw away her sim cards. The next day which was on the 26th  July she went to Ikoyi and changed some of the foreign currencies” When Amaha was interviewed she said she stole the money from her boss because she needed money to treat her sick mother. Narrating her story she said; “I came to Lagos in 2014 and I worked for Mrs Tina Okiro, I got the job through an agent, one Mr Sunday from Ogoja and while she was paying me N20,000 monthly, she also enrolled me in Lagos State Polytechnic Isolo, and was paying my school fees. But after staying for two and a half years she started complaining that I was keeping late at school and I was no longer performing my house chores. So, because she was complaining too much I left her house and went into the street and engaged in prostitution. But when my brother heard what I was doing he called me back home, so I went to the village and I also spent some time with my brothers in Onitsha. I later came back to Lagos and I worked with a woman in Ikorodu as a house help for three months before I went back to the village and started farming. I came to Lagos again to look for job to raise money. I approached one Mr Frank who was a job agent who led me to one Mr. Ade who in turn linked me to the woman in Surulere. Before I started working for the woman she told me about herself, what my job entailed and my salary would be paid through my agent. But I gave her fake name and fake address because I had the intention of stealing from her. So I got to the woman’s house around 12 noon and we went to the airport around 3:30pm to pick her sister and we packed all the woman’s luggage. I opened the luggage and took money from it. I stole a total of $700 and 100 pounds. I changed $100 which I used to make my hair and bought a new sleepers and I deposited the remaining money into my account”.
