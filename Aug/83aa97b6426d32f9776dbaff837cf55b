A top source in EFCC confirmed the release of the four officials at 5pm on Thursday but said they were ordered to report back on Friday and Monday next week to continue with interrogation over the role in the cash pay-out, which the potential benefiting communities have denied ever receiving. The top source, which is close to the investigation, said: “The suspects have been able to produce some vital documents required by the commission on the matter but we want them to report to us in the next few days to compare notes on what they have brought. “Certain documents on compensation have also been submitted to the investigators, but key records pertaining to authorisation of payment are still outstanding; and we need them urgently for the assignment at hand,” the source said.

It will be recalled that the federal government had directed the EFCC to look into how the Obasanjo administration allegedly expended $16 billion on power projects across the country with little or nothing to show for it, thereby making the country to lose value for money. The contract has become a highly controversial issue since Obasanjo left office especially as the power situation in the country continues to worsen.
