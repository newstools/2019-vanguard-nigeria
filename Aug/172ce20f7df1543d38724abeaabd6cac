Matthew Bernard, Emily Bivens’ teenage brother, was later arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder, local news reports said. Bernard was detained after an hours-long manhunt ended in a bizarre stand-off. Images of the teenager’s capture showed him being led away naked by local law enforcement. Pittsylvania County Sheriff’s office have not formally released the names of the victims but multiple reports identified them as the family of minor league pitcher Bivens.
