Yaya-Kolade, who was represented by the Director Hospital Services and Training, Dr. Rufus Adetoye said the State Government would not tolerate  quackery  in medical practice and will deal decisively with  anyone caught in the act. He said: “The intention of the state government, through the committee, is to  stamp out quackery in the state and to eradicate quackery in our dear  state and the way innocent people are being killed must stop.” She disclosed that unqualified doctors were discovered at some of the hospitals visited and this warranted sealing up of the facilities. Some of the health facilities visited included Omole Hospital, Adedamola Hospital and Divine Citadel Hospital, all in Ado-Ekiti and Divine Hospital and Maternity Home, Ilawe-Ekiti. The commissioner reiterated that the visit of the committee and the law enforcement agency would be a continuous exercise until Ekiti State is rid of medical quackery. He said: “We are using this medium to enlighten the public that you are endangering your life if you visit or patronize Divine Citadel Hospital, Ado-Ekiti and Ilawe-Ekiti, Omole Clinic at Omisanjana, Adedamola Hospital and Maternity Home, Ajilosun, Ado-Ekiti and other hospitals that are not being manned by qualified Doctors. You are rather advised to visit government hospitals for quality health care.” @vanguardngrnews Vanguard
