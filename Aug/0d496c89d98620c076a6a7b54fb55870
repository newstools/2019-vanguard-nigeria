Super Eagles stars have taken the French Ligue 1 by storm this season starting with Victor Osimhen who scored twice on his debut for Lille on the opening weekend of the season. The trend continued last night as Moses Simon scored the winners on his debut in the French topflight as Nantes beat 10-man Amiens at Stade de la Beaujoire. Simon who joined The Canaries on loan from Spanish side, Levante, came on the 72nd minute to score the winner after South African forward, Bongani Zungu had cancelled out Kaifa Coulibaly’s 52nd-minute opener for Nantes.
