It would be recalled that some hoodlums, who pretended to have come to lodge a complaint at the station, turned around to attack the station in the early hours of Sunday. The commissioner said that the station did not record any case of missing rifles as being erroneously speculated in a section of the media. The police boss said, “There was no loot or any rifle missing from our preliminary investigation.

The police commissioner said that four policemen sustained minor bullet wounds, adding that they were responding to treatment and would soon be discharged from the hospital. He said that the command was trailing the fleeing hoodlums and gave the assurance that they would be apprehended, along with their sponsors. He urged hospitals and doctors to report anyone with bullet wounds to the nearest police station. He said that he had ordered full investigation into the incident in order to ensure that the suspects were arrested and brought to book.
