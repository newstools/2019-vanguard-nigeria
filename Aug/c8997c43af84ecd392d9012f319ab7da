Alex Iwobi could be waiting a little while longer to make his Everton debut. Iwobi made his Everton switch on deadline day from Arsenal last week and was not included in the squad that drew 0-0 at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Having featured at the African Cup of Nations this summer, Iwobi has barely had a pre-season. He resumed training with Everton yesterday. “He was on holiday after the Africa Cup. “He started on Monday and let’s see how he reacts but there is a big gap between him and his team-mates, the physical condition will be a big gap, but let’s see. “Normally my decisions come from the training sessions and let’s see how he will play, how he will do in the training sessions. “After that I will take my decision on Friday.” Everton host Watford at Goodison Park next weekend.
