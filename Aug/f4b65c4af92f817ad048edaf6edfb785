The Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan on Friday  dismissed the appeal by the Labour Party against the election of Prince Dapo Abiodun as Governor of Ogun State. The Court  described the Labour Party’s repeated challenge of the Ogun State Governor as lacking merit and  frivolous. Court upheld the submission of Abiodun and All Progressives Congress (APC) counsel, Barrister Wale Abeeb Ajayi that the governor was duly elected. The LP went on appeal after losing at the Tribunal for the third time in its quest to use the court to cancel the March 9, gubernatorial election in Ogun State. On July 13, when the LP went to challenge the outcome of the polls, the Tribunal in Abeokuta led by Justice Ali Halilu dismissed the case on the ground that the tribunal had dismissed the petition pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 46(3) of the Schedule to the Electoral Act, 2010 as amended.
