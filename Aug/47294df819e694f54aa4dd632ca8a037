The theme of the forum is “Unveiling Investment Opportunities and Government Incentives in Africa for International Investors and Benefits from Bilateral Agreements’’. Anyaoku said the call became necessary in view of the fact that no nation could achieve a stable development without security, rule of law and respect for human rights. According to him, having achieved independence on the basis of the belief in democracy, the challenge Africa faces today is to consolidate on democracy and make democracy real in their individual countries. “Democracy is not an event, it is a process, it goes slowly along to consolidate and entrench democratic ideals. “Africa is still struggling to develop its social-economic potential because colonialism in the continent was based on the principle of extracting raw materials by the colonial masters. “Infrastructure was neglected; power was neglected, education and health facilities were inadequate and roads and railways were focused only to enable the transfer of raw materials from their sources to the seaports. “The challenge of Africa today is the development of its social economic potential, consolidation on its democracy and internal security because unless a society is secure, it cannot develop meaningfully,” he said. Anyaoku called on African leaders to build unity within the continent in a practical, integrated and collaborative manner.

He said the formation of sub-regional organisations would help to build the infrastructure needed to develop the regions. According to him, the cooperation that Africa needs to boost intra-African trade is the expansion of possibilities of trade within the continent.
