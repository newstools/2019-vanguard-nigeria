With the launch of the MoneyPal app however, the company will now be able to cater to the lending needs of non-salary earners as it seeks to deepen its financial inclusion strategy across the country. Osagie said the company’s aim is to be a true partner for success, enhancing the lifestyle of every Nigerian by providing access to credit through different offline and online channels, hence the launch of the #MadeForYou Campaign. The app is available on Google Play Store for Android devices and will soon be launched on the Apple Store for iOS users. Vanguard
