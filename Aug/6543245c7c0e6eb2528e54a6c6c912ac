Nigeria International Samuel Chukwueze was on target as Villarreal were held by Granada 4-4 at the Estadio de la Cerámica in their La Liga opener on Saturday. Santi Cazorla drew the first blood from the spot before Granada levelled up through Fede Vico, who also converted from the penalty spot. Moi Gomez restored the Yellow submarine’s lead, but the visitors were level again after evading Villarreal defender, Ruben Pena to put the ball into his own net.
