“The clash cut across three villages. There is no reason for these attacks. Several peace meetings with the communities have yielded no positive results,”  Anene said. An eyewitness told NAN that the gunmen who numbered more than 10 opened fire on the mourners killing and injuring several persons in the process. The gunmen attacked the mourners in the early hours of Saturday as a result of which four persons lost their lives on the spot while several others sustained severe injuries. The area has witnessed serious criminal activities in the past four years. (NAN)
