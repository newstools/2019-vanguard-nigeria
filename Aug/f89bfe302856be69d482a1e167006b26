Tyson Fury has hit back at Anthony Joshua after his rival ridiculed him for fighting Otto Wallin. The Gypsy King takes on little-known Swedish fighter Wallin in Las Vegas in September in another tune-up fight ahead of his rematch with Deontay Wilder next year, but Joshua wasn’t impressed with the opponent selection. Joshua said he would never fight ‘lower-tier heavyweights’. After hearing the comments, Fury responded by questioning the caliber of Andy Ruiz Jr – AJ’s next opponent. ‘What about Andy Ruiz then? Was he a top tier heavyweight when he fought him? He got knocked out by him,’ Fury told Behind the Gloves. ‘No he wasn’t, that’s the answer to that question. Nobody knew who Andy Ruiz was. He was a two-week replacement opponent. ‘People only become somebody by getting an opportunity. This time last year Andy Ruiz was nobody, absolutely f****** nobody. ‘Today he’s heavyweight champion of the world. If he wasn’t given the opportunity on two weeks notice then nobody would know his name. READ ALSO: Tyson Fury, Wilder match ends in controversial draw ‘He contradicts himself quite a lot actually.

These guys are cream of the crop, they shouldn’t be fighting them type of people…I can’t fight Wallin, don’t think I can ever fight lower-tier heavyweights.’ Asked why he thought Joshua was hitting out at his rivals more frequently, Fury replied: ‘He got his ass handed to him by Andy Ruiz, so now he thinks he needs to talk a bit more.’ VANGUARD
