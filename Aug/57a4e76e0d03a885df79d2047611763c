The find amounts to about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas and 60 million barrels of associated condensate in the deep drilled sequences. “The discovery has further potential that will be assessed with the next appraisal campaign. The well can deliver in excess of 100 million standard cubic feet/day of gas and 3,000 barrels/day of associated condensates, and will be immediately put on-stream to increase NAOC’s gas production.”    Nigeria Agip Oil Company(NAOC), an affiliate of the Italian oil giant, Eni, says it has discovered a significant quantity of gas and condensate in the Obiafu-Obrikom fields in Oil Mining Lease, (OML) 61, onshore Niger Delta.
