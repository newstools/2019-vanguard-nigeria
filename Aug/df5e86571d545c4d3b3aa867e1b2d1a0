They told me I shouldn’t be playing,” Lee said after the match. “It was definitely difficult, but my friends and family helped me get through. I wanted to show everyone that I could do this. “My message for people who are hearing impaired is to not be discouraged. If you try hard, you can do anything.” Next up for Lee is a second-round meeting with third seed Hubert Hurkacz of Poland on Tuesday.

Murray battled hard to save three set points in the tiebreak before Sandgren converted the fourth to end the 74-minute first set when the Briton’s volley found the net. Murray was broken in the opening game of the second set and fell 3-0 behind before breaking back to leave the set poised at 5-5. But the 28-year-old American broke back and then served out the match to set up a second round clash with Canadian second seed Denis Shapovalov.(NAN) Vanguard
