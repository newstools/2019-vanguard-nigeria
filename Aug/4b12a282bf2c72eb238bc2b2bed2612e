I believe that music is in me and I am talented. I really don’t care about the money or fame that comes with it. I love music. As for the money that comes with it, that’s the record label’s business.” Currently signed to a self-owned record label and managed by Lotus Promotions, OJ Danley revealed that he is inspired by legendary Nigerian artiste, 2Baba “I look up to 2Baba. He inspires me a lot. The very song that made me pick so much interest in him is ‘African Queen’. He is a role model and a mentor to me. “ Revealing his weirdest experience from female fans, OJ Danley who started doing music from the church said “Back then in school, I did an RnB song titled “Every I Go”, and everywhere I went, girls were always all over me. I am the shy type and I don’t know how to dance, yet they liked to come all over me because of my voice.” The fast-rising act is not resting on his oars in his quest to take the industry by storm. “Right from my days in the church choir, I have never been in a competition with anybody. Whatever it is that I do, I put all of my best to it and I don’t look to compete. That is how I get inspired. I like to let anything beyond me to God. I am not in any competition with anybody” Vanguard
