At a reception for the former PPA members in Awka by the Anambra State PDP leadership, Ezeemo also announced his intention to contest the 2021 governorship election on the platform of PDP, thus becoming the first aspirant to make his ambition known to the leadership of the party. He said: “From the situation on ground PDP has all it takes to govern the state after a long wait. With my departure from PPA, there is nothing left in that party, as all those who made the party what it was in Anambra State also left with me. “Now that we have joined PDP, we want the leadership of the party to support whoever the people would select as their candidate for the forthcoming election. 26 year-old teacher becomes millionaire after winning Betway’s AFCON jackpot(Opens in a new browser tab) “I like transparency and I hope there will be transparency during PDP primaries.
