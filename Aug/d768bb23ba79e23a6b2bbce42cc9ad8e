Alex Iwobi has disclosed that the desire to make a name for himself and to shake off the ‘youngster’ tag at Arsenal propelled him to join Everton. The 23-year-old teamed up with the Toffees on transfer deadline day, becoming the seventh summer signing by Marco Silva. Iwobi, a nephew to legendary Austin Jay Jay Okocha, started in the Gunners academy before breaking into the first team, where he went on to make 149 senior appearances for the side, scoring 15 goals.
