This is on the account that they will not allow him use their country to internationalise his group’s activities. “The Nigerian government commended the stand of the Indian Government and also apologise to her for the ‘unruly behaviour’ of El-Zakzaky”, the statement read. Meanwhile, the spokesperson of IMN, Ibrahim Musa said in a statement obtained by Vanguard that contrary to reports Zakzaky didn’t refuse treatment in India but that “the interference of the government raised suspicion that it was planning to kill the Sheikh in India using its international connections hence he insisted that if he would not be allowed to see the doctors that brought him to India he would rather come back to Nigeria and seek another destination for his treatment. “This became clear because of the government’s stance insisting on other doctors than the ones that he was in India to meet. They finally decided to bring him back for refusing to succumb to be treated by their chosen doctors.’ Vanguard
