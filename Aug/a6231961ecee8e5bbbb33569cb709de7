We understand the need to continually evolve as we serve the industry. We are glad that with this partnership, we can fully support and encourage everyone to fund real estate projects.” Vistafront will be gleaning from the wealth of experience that Landwey has in the real estate business, to launch different projects that will be made available for funding on the platform. There is an ongoing project called Bloom 1, it is a bridge financing for land acquisition for 14,000 square meters nested in the heart of Lekki Epe Expressway, Lagos State, Nigeria. With as low as N25,000 per unit you can fund as many units as you like and make 12% return in 6 months. Vistafront’s mission is to provide quality infrastructure for all, so 1% of every unit you fund goes toward Social Infrastructure Impact Project (SIIP) like schools, community homes, hospitals and other social amenities accessible to the less privileged. However, once 1% of your total funding reaches N10,000 for any project, Vistafront will automatically place a cap so that the total amount you pay for SIIP does not exceed N10,000 irrespective of the number of units funded. Segun Ajuwon, Managing Director of Vistafront says, “We have gotten a lot of positive feedback since we launched and we have plans to continue to launch new projects. For every project we feature on the site, we also have in place a strict vetting process carried out by our in-house team and our other partners like Nachtwey Advisory Services Limited, a SEC registered Asset Management company, Emerging Africa Capital Group, a licensed Trustee firm and AXA Mansard, a trusted insurance company.” VANGUARD The steadfastness that successful business people have, enabling them to stand the test of time in a competitive and challenging business environment motivates me July 17, 2019 In "Interview" Nigeria’s most innovative real estate company, LandWey Investment Limited has collaborated with PiggyVest, the largest online savings and investing platform in Nigeria to support low and medium-income brackets to actualize their dream of premium land ownership.
