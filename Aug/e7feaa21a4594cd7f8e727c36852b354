BENIN CITY—FEW days after motor spare part sellers at Uwelu market in Edo State lost millions of naira wotth of goods to a midnight fire, a group, Coalition for Good Governance and Economic Justice in Nigeria, CGGEJ, yesterday, said the inability of the Governor Goodwin Obaseki administration to equip the state’s fire service contributed to the huge loss suffered by the traders. A statement by the group’s Country Director, John Mayaki, said it was embarrassing that the state government would wait for such a monumental disaster before thinking of how to revamp the state fire service It will be recalled that the state Commissioner for Youth and Special Duties, Damian Lawani, took a tour of fire fighting stations and equipment for on the spot assessment of fire stations and admitted that there were faulty vehicles and outdated fire fighting equipment.

He said “The fact that this inspection that is at least three years late and is coming after no fewer than five major fire outbreaks in Benin City and beyond that claimed lives and property, is described by the government as ‘proactive’ is not only comically silly, but an insult on the sensibilities of all well-thinking citizens of Edo State.” Vanguard
