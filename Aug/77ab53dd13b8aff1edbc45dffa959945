The customer receives an email prompting them to follow a link and rate his/her satisfaction level on a 1-5 scale. The aggregated score from over 1,000 customer respondents the first half of 2019 (H1 2019)  places the company at four star or 80 percent pass mark.” Commenting on the company’s  key source of competitive advantage, Owolabi Salami, Executive Director, Allianz Nigeria said, “We ensure that all of our people always talk straight. Then, we make certain that we walk the talk. If we say we will pay your claim, we pay it. We try to avoid resorting to evasion tactics like requesting supporting documents that were never in the picture from the start. This is crucial in building trust.” Owolabi said that once you can create the trust connection with customers, they simply keep coming back.

Uti explains that this is yet another way the company endeavours to talk straight and walk the talk. “We don’t offer the 15 percent bonus as a renewal discount; we don’t insist you have to stay. We simply write you a check or transfer the cash direct to your bank account – there is zero obligation”, she added. The company said that in the first half of 2019 alone, it has paid cashback bonus of N3 million to nearly 100 customers. Vanguard
