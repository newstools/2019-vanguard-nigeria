This came barely 24 hours after a free-for-all broke out between some Hausa and Yoruba traders over a minor misunderstanding in the same area. Fortunately too, nobody died during the incident. It was gathered that the fire which started at exactly 3.15am, destroyed the entire stretch of shops where fairly used clothes are being sold located opposite the Central Mosque in the market.
