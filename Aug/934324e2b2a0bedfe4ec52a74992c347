Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, said players need more protection from social media companies, describing racist abuse and death threats directed at them as “serious incidents.” United midfielder, Paul Pogba was the target of online abuse after missing a penalty in Monday’s 1-1 Premier League draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers, prompting the club to issue a strong statement condemning the views.

When there’s death threats and racism, it’s serious allegations, serious incidents,” Solskjaer told reporters on the eve of Saturday’s clash with Crystal Palace. “Sometimes you get annoyed, what can we do about it as Manchester United? We’re not going to ban our players on social media, we have to spread the good word instead.” Solskjaer backed Frenchman Pogba to rise above the abuse and emerge stronger. “Paul is fine, he’s a strong character and it makes him stronger. I cannot believe we still sit here in 2019 talking about these instances,” the Norwegian added. “Social media is a place where people can hide behind fake identities. There’s so many Ole Gunnar Solskjaers on social media that I know are not me. “The authorities have got to do something about the ones who spread this hate.

Let’s see when we get the next one. We’re practising penalties still,” Solskjaer said. “There’s no fighting among them. We’re disappointed that we didn’t win the game, but the talk is always more difficult when you don’t get a result.” United are holding talks with other clubs over the transfer of Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez, who played in a behind-closed-doors friendly with Sheffield United on Tuesday. “There are still talks with some clubs but he played in that game and played well, he’s working hard… let’s see in September what’s going to happen,” Solskjaer added.(Reuters/NAN) Vanguard Manchester United's victory against Tottenham is a statement win for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but the team's reliance on David de Gea's heroics in goal show the interim boss still has work to do.
