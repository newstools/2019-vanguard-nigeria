The 80-man fraud list has put Nigeria and indeed Nigerians on a dark spot on global map of integrity, denting an already fragile image among comity of nations. The reactions among Nigerians underscores how big a blow this is to most populous black nation in the world. 80 Nigerians Arrested by FBI Nigerians: they have spoilt our reputation, they have spoilt our name Come what is OUR ?Did you see Roviel there ?

I pray they arrest all the guilty ones amongst the 80 Nigerians indicted. They put it out in the open to let the whole world know its over to Nigeria to source for these citizens.  FGs next line of action is very critical. — 🇨🇦Onyeisi Canada🇨🇦 (@Prinxcharles01) August 23, 2019  Aside these 80 Nigerians caught, there are still others doing same fraud in Yankee ooooh & won't learn their lessons now.
