The Molped sanitary pad which launched into the Nigerian market on the 23rd of April 2019, has managed to carve a niche for itself as a brand that goes beyond just offering protection for women on their periods. The brand is one that focuses greatly on female friendship, bond and confidence as shown with the creation of the MoGirls community. <img class="wp-image-1235585 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=500%2C334&#038;ssl=1" alt="Molped" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=58%2C39&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=260%2C174&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=195%2C130&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=115%2C77&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?resize=560%2C374&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Molped3.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The hangout is the first of the kind, as no other sanitary brand has organized such before in Nigeria. Hayat Kimya is an international brand which produces household products and has Molped Sanitary pad available in countries like Turkey, Macedonia, Iran, to mention a few. In attendance at the event was their Brand Ambassador, the award-winning singer and songwriter, Chidinma Ekile. The singer who was unveiled as the face of the brand at their launch event in April, was the main attraction of the get together. There were loads of activities, games and health talks by professionals. The guests were educated on female period hygiene and female health as a whole by Dr Dolapo Olaosibikan. The Kedike crooner also gave a surprise performance at the end of the event. During the speech given by the brand manager, Onyinyechi Nwosu, the guests were reminded of the fact that they were also ambassadors of the brand and that Molped sanitary pad was the convergence point, for every Moâ€™Girl. <img class="wp-image-1235587 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=500%2C652&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="652" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=230%2C300&amp;ssl=1 230w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=768%2C1001&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=786%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 786w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=45%2C58&amp;ssl=1 45w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=149%2C194&amp;ssl=1 149w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=100%2C130&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?resize=560%2C730&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mogirls.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
