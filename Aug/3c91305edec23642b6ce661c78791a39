National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has said that the alleged rift between himself and his successor, Governor Godwin Obaseki is the creation of people with personal interest, describing Obaseki as his brother. Oshiomhole said this on Monday night while receiving Governor Obaseki, who led members of his cabinet to celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir Festival with his former boss, at his Iyamoh residence in Estako West Local Government Government Area of the state. Speaking to journalists after a closed-door meeting which lasted for about an hour, Oshiomhole said the meeting was not unusual as he was in constant touch with Governor Obaseki. According to Oshiomhole, “from time to time, we have always been meeting. It is not an unusual visit, the meeting afforded me the opportunity to meet with my brother and with people I have worked with.” Just in: PDP BOT Chairman, Walid Jibrin backs RUGA Oshiomhole added that it was unfortunate that the media liked creating factions for their own gain. Obaseki also noted that the visit to his predecessor was not unusual, saying that he decided to celebrate Sallah with his former boss. He said the visit was to celebrate Edo leaders just as the former APC national chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, was celebrated by the state earlier in the day. “There is nothing unusual about this meeting; today is Sallah and we have just finished celebrating with the former APC national chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun in Benin City, and we decided to come here to celebrate Sallah with my predecessor,” the governor said. He added that people who think there was a rift between him and his predecessor should stop thinking.
