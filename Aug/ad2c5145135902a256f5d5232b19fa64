AS President Muhammadu Buhari swears in the 43 ministers-designate on Wednesday, all eyes are on him to see the portfolios he will assign the seven women and 36 men.  Will, he put square pegs in square holes and round pegs in round holes? Will it be round pegs in square holes or square pegs in round holes? Will he saddle some ministers with tasks that are beyond their competence or too many duties as was witnessed in 2015? <img class="size-full wp-image-1241059 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=640%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="483" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=1024%2C773&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=58%2C44&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=257%2C194&amp;ssl=1 257w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=172%2C130&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?resize=560%2C423&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/minister-pix.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Following a groundswell of calls on him to avoid the mistakes of 2015 by forming his second-term cabinet on time, President Buhari on July 11, 2019, made a shocking remark. At a maiden dinner with the new leadership of the National Assembly, he vowed that only tested persons who are capable of delivering on assigned mandates would make his cabinet. Practically passing a vote of no confidence on some of his out-gone ministers, he unwittingly blamed them, his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, and some individuals for the flaks his administration has faced since he assumed power on May 29, 2015, on account of the poor performance of some ministers. President Buhari assured that this time he would appoint those he knew to help drive his next level agenda. “I’m very much aware of it. I’m under tremendous pressure on it (appointment of ministers). But the last cabinet which I headed, most of them, the majority of them I didn’t know them. I had to accept the names and recommendations from the party and other individuals. “I worked with them for three and a half years at least; meeting twice or two weeks in a month. So I know them now.  But this time around, I’m going to be quite me in the sense that I will pick people I personally know”,  he vowed. Indeed, the president took steps that are markedly different from what he did in 2015. Exactly 55 days after his swearing-in for the second term, he sent the list of ministerial nominees to the Senate for screening and confirmation. The number was seven higher than the 36 he submitted in 2015. This time he did it in less than two months compared to the 124 days or four months it took him to send his first list of nominees on September 30, 2015. If the ministers-designates are sworn-in on Wednesday, it means the president will get his second term cabinet ready in 84 days, that is two months and 23 days. This is remarkably better than the over six months it took him to do so in 2015. As the August 21 swearing-in date beckons, will President Buhari continue with the improvements observed so far with the assignment of portfolios? Interestingly, he re-appointed 14 of his first term ministers. Will the returnees retain their portfolios or will they get other jobs? In terms of 35 per cent Affirmative Action, there is little or no difference in the number of women nominated in 2015 and now even though the lot of women was marginally better four years ago. In 2015, there were six women (16.67 per cent) in a list of 36. Now, there are seven women (16.28 per cent) in a list of 43. The seven women nominated are Pauline Tallen (former minister and deputy governor of Plateau); Mariam Katagun (Nigeria’s ambassador and permanent delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO); Sadiya Farouq (federal commissioner of National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons); Sharon Ikeazor (Member of APC BoT and executive secretary of Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate, PTAD); Gbemisola Saraki (former senator); Ramatu Tijjani (national women leader of the APC), and Zainab Ahmed (immediate past minister of Finance). Looking at the list, one question on the lips of observers is whether or not they can drive President Buhari’s Next Level Agenda. No doubt, most of them boast of fine credentials and experience but a host of them were part of the last cabinet, whose performance has been wrapped in divergent arguments. The list includes seven former governors, seven former senators, a collection of party leaders in some states and a couple of fresh nominees, whose names do not ring a bell in the political firmament. Pedigree of the ministers Given their credentials and pedigree, a host of the ministers-designates can make an appreciable impact if properly deployed as a peep into their pedigree and accomplishments reveals.
