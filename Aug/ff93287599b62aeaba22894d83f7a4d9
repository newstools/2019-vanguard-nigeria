The senator representing Abia-South senatorial district, Enyinnaya Abaribe has condemned the attack on the former deputy senate president, Dr Ike Ekweremadu by members identified as the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Abaribe, who along with two other sureties bailed Nnamdi kanu, frowned at the incident that happened yesterday at Nuremberg, Germany, noting that it was un-Igbo for IPOB members in Germany to treat Ekweremadu that way.

The perpetrators of the attack should know that as the Igbo, we respect elders and reverence our leaders. “The unwarranted attack is not the character of the Igbo. This is un-Igbo. “It is most worrisome and even inconceivable that the attackers will choose an auspicious occasion where our people are celebrating and showcasing our rich culture to exhibit such unbecoming and condemnable conduct in the name of agitation. “No, that was not agitation, no right thinking human will identify with such behaviour.
