Breast milk is the ideal food for babies. It contains all the necessary nutrients for a baby’s healthy growth, contains antibodies that help protect babies against illnesses such as pneumonia and diarrhoea and it is linked to the prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS); it is also readily available and cost effective. “In line with 2019’s theme for World Breastfeeding Week – ‘Empower Parents, Enable Breastfeeding’, it is important for all parents to be included in the process of breastfeeding and be informed on what to do to make it a great journey. We should all work together to create enabling environments everywhere for breastfeeding to happen naturally and optimally. At AXA Mansard, we will continue to be at the forefront of making the world a healthier place,” Adeniyi said. Vanguard
