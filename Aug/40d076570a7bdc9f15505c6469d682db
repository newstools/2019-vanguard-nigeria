He further informed that in a recent IFC report, Africa was noted as having a slow and insufficient policy response to digital transformation, stressing that respondents called for accelerated efforts in developing clear-cut digital agendas. “This includes modernizing school curriculum, training teachers, expanding broadband access, promoting a vibrant business climate by encouraging competition, and enforcing cyber security. Today, resources such as the AI Business School geared specifically towards government can be the first step for governments looking to up-skill their employees.

To do so, they began efforts at government level, appointing the first dedicated Minister of AI. The effort was applauded for ensuring a necessary focus for implementation as opposed to just talking and ensuring solutions are based on the latest understanding of technology. “For Africa to truly succeed,  and lead in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, innovative startups, technology companies and smart businesses need to collaborate on building an ecosystem where everyone benefits from technology. Leading this charge needs to be progressive governments with their road maps that both define and enable the digital horizon”, Abdella noted. Vanguard
