ADO-EKITIâ€”THE Ekiti House of Assembly, yesterday, invited eight local government chairmen for an interface with the joint Committee on Public Petitions and Public Accounts on Friday. The News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that the 16 council chairmen were suspended in December 2018 over alleged misappropriation of public funds. The Assembly, however, in July reinstated eight of the chairmen. Those reinstated were for Ijero, Moba, Gbonyin, Ado, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Ikole, Ekiti SouthWest and Ekiti West. In a statement issued in Ado-Ekiti by the House Majority Leader, Chief Gboyega Aribisogan, the House said the interface was aimed at discussing the petition written to it by the affected council chairmen challenging their suspension from office. Aribisogan said apart from the issues relating to their suspension, other matters regarding their stewardship would also be discussed. He listed the affected council chairmen as those of Oye, Ise/Orun, Ekiti East, Ikere, Efon, Ido/Osi, Emure and Ilejemeje.
