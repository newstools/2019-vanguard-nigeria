The United States Embassy in Nigeria, Tuesday introduced a reciprocity fee for all approved applications for non-immigrant visas in B, F, H1B, I, L, and R visa classifications. A statement by the Public Affairs Section of the embassy, said the development was informed by what it described as the failure of Nigerian government to change the fees charged to U.S. citizens for certain  categories of Nigerian visa. It added that the action was meant to eliminate the cost difference.

Since early 2018, the U.S. government has engaged the Nigerian government to request that the Nigerian government change the fees charged to U.S. citizens for certain visa categories.  After eighteen months of review and consultations, the government of Nigeria has not changed its fee structure for U.S. citizen visa applicants, requiring the U.S. Department of State to enact new reciprocity fees in accordance with our visa laws. “The reciprocity fee will be required for all Nigerian citizens worldwide, regardless of where they are applying for a nonimmigrant visa to the United States.  The reciprocity fee is required for each visa that is issued, which means both adults and minors whose visa applications are approved will be charged the reciprocity fee.  The fee can only be paid at the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulate General.  The reciprocity fee cannot be paid at banks or any other location.
