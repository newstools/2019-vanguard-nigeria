On-loan striker Eddie Nketiah came off the bench to score a 81st-minute winner as Leeds beat Brentford 1-0 on Wednesday to go back to the top of the English Championship. The 20-year-old, on loan at Elland Road from Arsenal, had only been on the pitch four minutes when he scored from a close range cross from Helder Costa as Leeds went to 10 points after four games in the race for a Premier League place. “We deserved to win the game because we dominated. We didn’t create a lot of chances but we created enough chances to make a difference,” Leeds coach Marcelo Bielsa told the BBC. “It was a physical, demanding game and we took control in the best moment of the game. “Helder Costa is a balanced player who can play on both sides, and Eddie Nketiah can make an impact in the middle. We defended well and our opponents did not have enough clear chances.” Swansea are second, also with 10 points, after a 3-1 win at QPR.
