Adio stated this while receiving the Auditor General of the Federation, Mr. Anthony Ayine on a courtesy visit to NEITI.
According to him, poor linkages among relevant agencies had been major constraints in national planning, natural resource governance and public finance management. He explained that it was not just enough for agencies in both the mining and petroleum industries to claim to be transparent, noting that it was about being comprehensively transparent to ensure that the information churned out was understood. He said, “Our doors are quite open; NEITI is ready and willing to work with sister agencies on information and data sharing, capacity and manpower development. “We are also ready to collaborate and partner with the Office of the Auditor General in particular and other similar agencies in general to promote data integrity, openness, standards and uniformity in data collation, validation management and utilization. “Anything that will bring about transparency in the management of revenues we will give you all the support”.
“We are working for the same purpose, we have to leverage on the strengths of the different agencies. We have done this for fifteen years and we have the information that will guide you in the extractive industry.” Adio pledged to work closely with the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation to promote integrity in data collation, validation and management on revenues from extractive industries.
