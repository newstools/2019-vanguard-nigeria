He gave the assurance that the state government was set to return them to their towns and villages as relative peace had returned to the state. “I believe all IDPs in the host communities want to go back to their homes rather than to continue to stay with the friends or relatives,’’ he said. Meanwhile, one of the returnees, Sani Saidu from Gusami village in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of the state, has commended the governor for the dialogue with the bandit. Saidu noted that it was the dialogue that made it possible for him and others to return to their ancestral homes. “Most of us did not have any form of disability but were forced out of our homes to live in IDP camps or with relatives as a result of the activities of the bandits. “We depended on begging and hard labour to survive; we shunned the temptation of joining the bad gang,’’ Saidu said, and lauded the governor for the peace iniative.
