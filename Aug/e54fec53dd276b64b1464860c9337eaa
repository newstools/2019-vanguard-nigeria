The clip x-rays the life of both kids as they wake up every morning, start their day and how it eventually gets routined. However, the big question that arises from the clip bothers on who house girls really are. Are they slaves or helps, as is commonly said. The unthinkable ways their services are been deployed in some houses has so far raised concerns and this clip is produced to tell this story.

This documentary delves into the social and economic elements that make this gross abuse thrive. “This is a fixture that has become very common in the average Nigerian home. Recently, social media users were touched by the message the video had to share. It has since gotten over 1m views in total and over 35,000 comments across all social media platforms and has pushed the conversation to a wider audience”, he said. Vanguard
