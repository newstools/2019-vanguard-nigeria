According to Ilomuanya, “Imo is greater than him and whatever selfish interest he is pursing. Governor Emeka Ihedioha is a man of peace, who is very civil and tolerant. He also does not believe in do-or-die politics, else Okorocha would have been made to feel the full consequences of his recent misdemeanour.
