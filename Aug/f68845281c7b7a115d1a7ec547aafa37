The theme of the conference is: “Fighting Corruption and Insecurity: The Way Forward’’. Mr Waheed Shittu, a lawyer and an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), noted that insecurity and corruption should be collectively tackled. Shittu, who was the Keynote Speaker, said that information sharing and investigation were vital in fighting corruption and insecurity. According to him, fighting insecurity is a collective effort and not the responsibility of government alone. “We should help to reduce opportunities that give rise to corruption,’’ he said. A former Commissioner of Police, Frank Oditah, said that the family which is the unit of society had a role to play.
