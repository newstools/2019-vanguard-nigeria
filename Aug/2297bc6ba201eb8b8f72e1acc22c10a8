The immediate past Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu has confirmed a physical assault on him by some members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, in Nuremberg, Germany, on Saturday. Enweremadu confirmed the attack in a statement released by his Media Assistant, Uche Anichukwu in Abuja. The News Agency o Nigeria (NAN) reports that a 64-second video about the attack had gone viral on the social media earlier on Saturday. In the video, Ekweremadu was seen being violently questioned over his alleged conspiracy with the Federal Government to proscribe the IPOB in the South East and killing several of its followers. NAN further reports that there were initial speculations on the veracity of the video where the senator was attacked with eggs by the irate IPOB members. The Senator who also gave account of the event on his social media handle, @iamekweremadu, however, assured that he was safe. He condemned the attack and said he had immediately reported it to the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr Yusuf Tuggar. He said: “I attended the Second Annual Cultural Festival and Convention organised by Ndi-Igbo Germany in Nuremberg today where I was billed to give a keynote address along with the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, who, however could not make it eventually. Ekweremadu being attacked in Germany stands condemned. But this is also a lesson to all Nigeria politicians if you think you're big and cannot be touched go abroad where your fuck up can actually be treated without the help of DSS or Police 😂😂😂#BoysArentSmiling😂 pic.twitter.com/5iCiqTL4n6 — Native Son (@Lordemzy5) August 17, 2019  “I was given a resounding welcome by Ndigbo in Germany and everything went smoothly until some men, who identified themselves as IPOB members stormed the venue and began to complain about the killings in the South East, stressing that there would be no Igbo event at the venue. “I tried to engage them, but when they became unruly, I had to leave the venue. The organisers also invited the police and I was accompanied out of the venue. Sen.

I want to assure them that I am hail and hearty. I have also spoken with the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar.” Senator Ike Ekweremadu got served today. Y’all politicians will get served like this one day. I love my Igbo brothers. No time to be dogbaleING for anybody. You mess up we treat it anywhere anyhow. @abikedabiri @MBuhari @aishambuhari. pic.twitter.com/3JJwoOfqAv — Uzor B N 💎 (@Raouc1) August 17, 2019  #RT NkemdiMary "RT chimbiko_jerome: What happened to  IKE EKWEREMADU IN NUREMBERG GERMANY Warning shot to Igbo criminals Nigeria politicians who go about looting and killing our people for nothing. pic.twitter.com/8MLs8dWObo" — Emeka Chuks (@Omambala_Chuks) August 17, 2019
