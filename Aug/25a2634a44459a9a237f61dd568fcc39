The plan came into being upon the realisation that Africa has about 50 percent of the world’s fertile and unused land estimated as 450 million hectares. Addressing a press conference in Lagos recently, Executive Director, Corporate and Investment Banking, Sterling Bank, Mr. Yemi Odubiyi,  said that the summit will address the issues preventing the agricultural sector from attaining its potential because food security on the continent has become a critical issue. Odubiyi said, “The agrarian land, which is the preserve of the continent, is now under threat because of issues of terrorism and other security concerns that have made some of those lands to be depopulated while there is a remarkable increase in population rate across the continent. According to him, this development has made it imperative to address the issue of food security which would in the long run also help to address unemployment, another major continental challenge. He said Sterling Bank has been a leading financial institution supporting large agricultural firms in the country by setting aside about 10 percent of its loan portfolio to the finance of the agriculture sector.
