That is why you observe that women, especially the pregnant ones, by the time they resume for work; they are always ready to continue with their services. Except for newspapers, I’ve no knowledge of my new Ministry – Aregbesola, Interior minister(Opens in a new browser tab) “Again, giving women six months is a very laudable thing. This is because the immunity of the child is very high because of the exclusive breastfeeding.” And that was what our parents did for us, and we grew up, not with this baby food we have now.” On her part, Chairperson, Lagos NAWOJ, Mrs. Adeola Ekine, commended the Ministry for empowering women and the cordial relationship the association has enjoyed, just as she called for collaboration with the association in training of her members.
