Nigeria and Everton legend Joseph Yobo claims Henry Onyekuru must prove his quality at new club Monaco. <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1239300" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Onyekuru-2.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The 22-year-old’s inability to secure a work permit in England cut his dream to play for the Toffees, having joined the Merseysiders in 2017. Before teaming up with the Monegasques on a five-year deal, Onyekuru was sent on loan to Anderlecht, and then Galatasaray, where he helped the Lions win a domestic double last season. Although Yobo feels disappointed about the young striker’s inability to represent the Goodison Park side owing to work permit issues, he believes Onyekuru’s move to Monaco is a new chapter for him – and must justify his worth to show what the Premier League is missing. “He is a fantastic talent and I would have loved to see his deal with Everton go through but work permit restricted him from playing in the Premier League,” Yobo told Goal. “But he has shown what he’s got at Galatasaray, very exciting to watch and he can score goals as well. I was happy seeing him play for Nigeria national team but he didn’t get that chance to play for Everton because he didn’t play more international games to give him the right. “For me as an Evertonian, I feel he is a good prospect and would have been a great talent for Everton. He did very well at Galatasaray and was one of the fans’ favourites and if he had his way, he would have stayed to continue his progress but then, the club wanted to do a different business which was against his wish.” After changing their managers thrice last season, Monaco were eliminated from the Champions League, the French Cup, and narrowly escaped relega-tion from Ligue 1. However, Yobo thinks playing for such team is a good chance for Onyekuru to show his class like he did in Turkey. “Monaco is a good team but haven’t done well in the past few years. Everything is now new for Henry to prove himself again,” Yobo continued. “He would have been happy at Galatasaray and done more because he knows the club and their culture but in Monaco, he must prove himself. He is a striker, young and still learning the trade. VANGUARD
