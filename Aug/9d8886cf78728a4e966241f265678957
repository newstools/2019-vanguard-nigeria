A breakdown of the deduction indicated that N141.6 billion was for under-recovery on petroleum products, N25 billion for crude and product losses and N130.4 billion for pipeline repairs and maintenance. “The Sum of N77.92 billion was under-remitted by NNPC to the Federation Account from Domestic Crude Allocation in 2017. “NNPC acknowledges the under-remittance and states that there is an on-going reconciliation to net off the N77.92 billion from the established Federation indebtedness to the Corporation of N797bn arising from KPMG Forensic audit of the Corporation at the instance of the Federation,” it noted On crude destination in 2017, the reports showed that the federation crude went to 29 destinations.
