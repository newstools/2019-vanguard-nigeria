He is already in London for the Genocide Exhibition, to tell his stories.” The pro-Biafra group further stated that “the London Exhibition will showcase the starvation and unnecessary attacks on the people of Biafra by Nigerian government, supported by British government. “It will draw attention of good people of the world, especially British people, who were not aware of what their government did to the people of Biafra between 1967 and 1970.” VANGUARD
