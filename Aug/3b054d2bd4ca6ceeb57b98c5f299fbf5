It begins with prayers, followed by a parade of the emir and his entourage on horses. In a statement signed by Abba Anwar, chief press secretary to the governor, Ganduje asked them to celebrate the festivity in their respective emirates, saying “against some calls circulating in the social media, that all district heads were directed to attend Hawan Daushe at Kano emir’s palace, the Kano State government has directed all Hakimai to attend Hawan Daushe at their respective emirates. It is therefore directed that, district heads from Bichi emirate should attend their Hawan Daushe with the first-class emir of Bichi, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, District Heads from Rano Emirate should attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class Emir Alhaji Dr Tafida Abubakar (Autan Bawo). “All district heads from Karaye emirate should attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class Emir, Alhaji Dr Ibrahim Abubakar II, all district heads from Gaya emirate should attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class emir, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdulkadir and those district heads from Kano emirate are also directed to attend Hawan Daushe with their first-class emir, Muhammadu Sanusi II.” The governor had earlier attended prayers led by Sanusi at the Kofar Mata Central Eid ground in Kano metropolis.

The monarch was also indicted by a panel which probed corruption allegations levelled against him. Sanusi had denied all the allegations. Vanguard
