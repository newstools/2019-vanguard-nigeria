Apart from the contemptuous conduct of the EFCC, it has also illegally impounded some properties belonging to the detainee, without any valid order of the court.” the group said. “For the purpose of clarity, the basis for the travail of Engr Babagana Abba Dalori, emanated from a business dealing, involving his company and some investors, who lost part of their financial investment after a flooding incident sometimes in the year 2018. The company lost sand and equipment to flooding in 2018, and attached to this letter, are copies of sympathy letters from Emirates in areas of operation to the company. The unfortunate incident which affected many of the dredging equipment of the company was brought to the notice of investors, thereby leading to some of them demanding a refund of their investment, thereby necessitating their involvement of the EFCC.” the petition read. The group further said the EFCC should be reminded, that all Nigerians are entitled to their fundamental rights to dignity and liberty guaranteed by sections 34 and 35 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended and articles 5 and 6 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights Ratification and Enforcement Act (Cap A9) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, as it urges the Human Rights Commission, to impress it upon the EFCC to immediately release Engr Dalori from unlawful custody or arraign them in court without any further delay. “The illegal detention of citizens without trial and against the directive of competent clearly violates human rights, and constitutes a threat to our hard-earned democracy,” it concluded.
