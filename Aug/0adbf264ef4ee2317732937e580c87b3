It was gathered that through tracking and interception facilities, investigators were able to discover conversations which gave out the roles of both the police and military personnel who had roles to play for the kingpin. The source added that it was for these reasons that the kidnap kingpin was able to elude several attempts by the police authorities to arrest him in the many years that he has been on their wanted list. “I can tell you that over 20 military and police personnel have been arrested since this investigation started. They gave the kingpin coverage all these years the police have been looking for him. This is the reason it has taken this long to get him,” said the source who pleaded anonymity.
