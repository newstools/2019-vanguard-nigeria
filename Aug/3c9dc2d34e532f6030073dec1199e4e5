He observed that these alterations  are deviations from the terms and conditions stated  in the deed of sub-lease signed by the two parties  and warned that it could lead to a penalty as stated in the Law. Akewusola noted that “The government owned  estates are designed and built by the state government in compliance  with global environmental and physical planning rules to ensure durability and liveability. Contravention of such standards often result in dire consequences such as reduced durability of structures both  for the home owners and people within the environment”.

He also underscored  the need for the residents to maintain the original  structural designs to   prevent future disasters, pointing out that “A building is a permanent load which capacity of erection can only be known and  accessed by certified engineers.
