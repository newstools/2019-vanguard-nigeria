He was a very generous leader who took delight in sharing his knowledge and experience for the good of society. “He was a rallying point for the Obaseki family, a respected Benin Chief and a great sports administrator. He served as Chairman of the Nigeria Premier League and 2nd Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation. He will be sorely missed. “I pray that the Almighty God grants his soul repose until we meet to part no more on Resurrection Morning.” Condolence messages have continued to pour in since the announcement of Chief Oyuki Obaseki’s passing at age 75, especially from sports administrators and soccer lovers. According to the President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi: “A truly big tree has fallen. We remember very much the work that Chief Oyuki Obaseki did to promote and project the elite division of the Nigeria League during his time as chairman. It was difficult to match his passion and energy as he pursued his vision for an independent League body. “We worked together at some point during the early days of the efforts to reposition the Nigeria Premier League. He took everything that needed to be done as a project and drove everyone else around him hard to play their own roles appropriately.” The football administrator who was known with the alias Moving Train was Chairman of the Premier League, and automatically the 2nd Vice President of the NFF during the presidency of Alhaji Sani Lulu Abdullahi from 2006-2010. vanguard
