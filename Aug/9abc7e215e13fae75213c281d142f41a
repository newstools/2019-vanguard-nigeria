Eli said that Dalung should not have been partisan and tribalistic in handling the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) crises during his tenure. “Dalung should have mediated between the factions in NFF as a patriotic Nigerian with passion for sports; however, the new minister can use sports to foster unity in the country if he avoids taking sides. “A good minister should use sports to foster unity in Nigeria and not taken side, so I advise Dare to see sports as a national issue. “He must see sports as the most unifying factor in the country given the rate of crises, as you can see how everybody rallies round the national teams during tournaments and all become happy in victory. “We are looking forward to see a situation where all the sports in the country will be taken proper care of.
