Turkish football star Arda Turan was given a suspended sentence of nearly three years over a brawl with a prominent singer, Turkish media reported on Thursday. The 32-year-old midfielder, currently on loan from Barcelona to Istanbul club Basaksehir, got into a dispute with singer Berkay Sahin last year outside an Istanbul nightclub, reportedly over the singer’s wife. The brawl left the singer, who is known by his first name, with a broken nose. In his testimony to police last year, the footballer said he went to the hospital where Berkay was taken, carrying a gun and asking to be shot if he had really harassed his wife.
