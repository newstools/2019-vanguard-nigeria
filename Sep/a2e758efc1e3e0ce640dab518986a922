Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) Joint Venture says it loses about N202 million daily in revenue to activities of criminals in the Niger Delta. The company attributed the loss to daily attacks on its pipelines by suspected crude oil thieves and vandals. SPDC’s General Manager, External Relations, Igo Weli, disclosed this at a media workshop on Pipelines Right of Way, Encroachment and Vandalism in Port Harcourt. “SPDC JV is currently losing about 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil or N202 million lost daily from its pipelines to crude oil thieves in the Niger Delta.

Weli said that the company had so far discovered and removed more than 1,160 illegal theft-points on its pipelines since 2012.

According to him, the Niger Delta is the most blessed region in the country going by the huge revenue allocated to the region by government and companies. “There is a community in the Niger Delta that has received over N2 billion from SPDC JV for its development, but is yet to develop. “The region receives 13 per cent derivation, revenue from NDDC and funds from companies, but still has not developed. “The Niger Delta has refused to develop despite the huge monies allocated to the area. So, we need to ask ourselves the critical questions to change the Niger Delta narratives,” he said. Vanguard (NAN).
