The youths, who said they met under the auspices of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide, said Bayelsa belongs to Ijaw people, adding that they would only support known indigenes, whose roots are traceable to other states. Anidi wondered what gave the youths the audacity to come up with such an idea, saying that Delta State today dominated by the Urhobo ethnic nationality has an Ijaw indigene, Barr. Kingsley Otuaro as the Deputy Governor. He said: “The claims that Bayelsa is a homogenous state is far from the truth because the state has the Urhobos, Isokos, Nembe, Ogbia,Epie Attisa and many other ethnic groups as Bayelsa State indigenes.

VANGUARD The Urhobo Progress Union (UPU), Youth Wing, Worldwide, has condemned the purported endorsement of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for a second term, saying that this does not represent the true position of the mind of Urhobo youths.
