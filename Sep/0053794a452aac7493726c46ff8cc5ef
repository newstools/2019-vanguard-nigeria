Aigbogun explained that the reason for the establishment of the tech start-up firm is to encourage the habit of savings in an economy that has been challenged by falling disposable income and low purchasing power, so as to enable them cushion effect of shocks from arising unforeseen circumstances. He said: “There are three plans for users who wish to save on Cashbox; the first is the regular saver designed mainly for salary earners. The Regular Saver allows users save any amount as low as N100 regularly on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the one convenient for the user. “Users on this plan earn between seven to 10 percent interest annually and are at liberty to suspend their savings at any time. They are also entitled to make four withdrawals at no cost, on the first day of the last month of every quarter, which is March, June, September and December and any withdrawal done outside these days attracts a five percent charge on the account,” he said. “The reason for the five percent deduction outside the free withdrawal days was to discourage users from seeing the platform as a traditional back by curtailing all forms of unnecessary withdrawals. The second plan is the Locked Savings which works like a normal fixed deposit account of Deposit “Money Banks, DMBs. Nonetheless, users get their interest upfront and minimum tenor for the plan is 90 days.
