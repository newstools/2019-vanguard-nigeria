Narrating her story Blessing Steven Said; ” I am a  hairstylist but I was a secondary school drop out. In 2008 I had a boyfriend known as Julius Abang and one year into our relationship I had a male child for him and I was living with my parent when I had the child and my mother was the person taking care of the child for me. “In 2012, I travelled to my village for a burial ceremony and I met a guy who held me down and we dated for two years and he chased me out of his house in 2014 when I became pregnant for him. One of my friends took me to Mforbong Itoro, who we normally call Mumssy,  at Nsit Ubiom Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and the woman offered to take care of my pregnancy and after my delivery,  she will take my baby from me and pay me off with the sum of N100,000. She told me that she was going to give my baby to someone looking for a child. “The baby was two-days old when I gave it to her and I don’t know where the baby is at the moment. I went home and I took the money to learn hairstylist. I learned the job for six months after which I came back to Ikota, Ajah, Lagos in 2016 and I got a househelp job at Lekki County Estate, where I  met, Isreal Ariyo, “We became friends and in 2018 I got pregnant for him, but Ariyo lost his job and we moved to Ibadan his home town. I delivered my last child in  May 2019,  but Ariyo suggested we should sell the child because he has no money to take care of the child. “I took the five-day-old baby to Mumssy in Akwa Ibom State and she paid me N250,000  for the child and I sent N100,000 instantly to Ariyo and I kept the rest to myself. I came back to Ibadan and opened a foodstuff business with it.  But before I got back to Ibadan, Ariyo had informed his family members that my child was dead so people believed me.
