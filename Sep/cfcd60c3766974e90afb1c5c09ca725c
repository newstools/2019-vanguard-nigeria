The electricity Distribution Companies, DISCOs, Monday berated the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, over its analogue system that has caused inefficiencies and 5,311 interface disruptions in one DISCOs in the first 18 days of this month.<img class="size-full wp-image-1256637 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=640%2C431&#038;ssl=1" alt="power, Enugu electricity coy arrests 10 suspected vandals" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=58%2C39&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=260%2C175&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=193%2C130&amp;ssl=1 193w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=115%2C77&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Electricity-distribution-in-Nigeria.jpg?resize=560%2C377&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors , ANED, which represents 10 DISCOs except Yola DISCO also said despite $1.6 billion multilateral funding of TCN, its equipment have caused over 100 electricity grid collapses since privatization in 2013, and nine collapses this year. Three ministries too much for Fashola, he now has grey hair – Okorocha(Opens in a new browser tab) The Executive Director, Research and Advocacy of ANED, Chief Sunday Oduntan, said in a statement that said it was responding to a recent TCN report that the DISCOs misrepresented crucial power evacuation and distribution data. Presenting the facts, ANED said it owes obligation to the 10 DISCOs who have invested about $1.4 billion in the networks, insisting that the DISCOs had not rejected energy load as TCN claimed in its publication. ANED also accused TCN of falsifying data that conflicts the data presented to DISCOs by the National Control Centre (NCC) which is under TCN and coordinate power allocation to DISCOs. While TCN headquarter data published on September 20th, 2019, shows 13,963 megawatts (MW) of energy was delivered to DISCOs between August 22nd and 24th of 2019, the NCC data actually shows it was 19,173MW. ANED said that indicated a conflicting difference of 5,208MW data within the same company. “It raises questions as to the veracity and accuracy of TCN’s response, in terms of the energy that it delivered to the DISCOs. How could TCN’s supposed sent-out or delivered energy exceed that recorded by its control centre, the singular source for such information,” ANED said.

ANED said the $1.6 billion federal government-guaranteed and multilateral funds and grants that TCN has gotten is unavailable to the privatized Generation Companies, GENCOs, and DISCOs. “Despite TCN saying it is implementing its Transmission Rehabilitation Expansion Programme, TREP, with the $1.6bn fund, “the reality is otherwise. “The Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry, NESI, continues to deal with, largely, a TCN that finds it difficult to move away from a PHCN-legacy of uncleared equipment containers, analogue-based and informal communications systems and frequent explosions and burnings of transmission sub-stations and transformers.” “The DISCOs said such substation fire recently put Agbor and Asaba towns of Delta State; and Oye, Ekiti State in blackout. “Over a hundred partial and total system collapse recorded since privatisation and nine total system collapses so far this year; multiple transmission interface deficiencies with 5,311 TCN interface interruptions in one DISCOs franchise area, from September 1 – 18, 2019.” Citing Siemens “Electrification Roadmap for Nigeria” report of May 7th, 2019, Oduntan said, “Today, power distribution by the Discos to end-customers is limited by power infeed from TCN. “Rather than eliminate all of the bottlenecks of the transmission grid, TCN, vociferously and continuously, continues to crow about its computer simulated increase in capacity, ignoring the fact that it, currently, only averages a daily 3,700MW of wheeled or transmitted energy to the DISCOs, out of its tested transmission capacity of 5,500 MW.” Saudi emerged from attacks ‘stronger than ever’ ― Saudi Aramco CEO(Opens in a new browser tab) “It also notes that TCN’s constant drumbeat of the need to re-capitalize the DISCOs distracts from the fact that any such re-capitalization cannot occur in an environment that lacks the following – respect for, or sanctity of contract; regulatory and policy certainty and consistency; ability of the sector operators to recover their costs of doing business; and an alignment of technical and commercial considerations. “TCN would be best served by first healing itself.” Vanguard Distribution companies, under the Association of Nigeria Electricity Distribution, ANED, have attributed the poor state of the country’s power supply to the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, calling it the weakest link in the power supply chain. August 25, 2016 In "News" WITHIN the first ten days of May, this year, Nigeria, once again suffered a series of nationwide blackouts due to a collapse of the transmission grid. Nigerians are, unfortunately, becoming accustomed to these highly unpalatable occurrences and each time they happen, they plant a thought in the mind of Nigerians… May 27, 2019 In "News" THE Electricity Distribution Companies, DISCOs, have disclosed that they installed 612,552 meters in different parts of the nation targeted at enhancing power distribution over the past four years.
