Adebayo, in his bid to expand his business frontiers, days back, inked a multi-million naira deal with JIANGMEN WANGYE MOTORCYCLE MANUFACTURING CO.,LTD, headed by MR Yi Chun. The deal, which was sealed at Adebayo’s Ibadan office in OJOO, would see the Chinese firm partnering with Basco on a number of new projects, part of which would make Basco the only distributor of new products from the company. While the business mogul would not reveal the details of the new deal yet, it was gathered that it would be another major milestone for Basco as the company continues to make remarkable impact in the motorcycle industry.
