  Speaking during a press conference as part of activities to remember those who were killed 52 years ago in Asaba, Azinge said though it would not approach the International Criminal Court to file criminal and genocide cases against the individuals or groups involved in the dastardly act not because they don’t have the capacity or because they would not want to go through the rigorous process but rather the government of the day should negotiate and do the right thing timely.  I don’t strive for popularity or heroism researching on the gruesome death of my kith and kin. In this terrible journey, I have witnessed death centers like Buchenwald, Mauthausen, and Dachau in Europe.
