According to Okon, “when the father came back home, the neighbour reported the matter to the father. After refunding the money, Essien sent him to buy kerosene. “Thereafter, Essien tied his son’s limbs in the front of his house, poured the kerosene on him and set him ablaze.” The community leader lamented how Essien watched his own son burn, noting that it was when the boy was rushed to the hospital, but did not make it that the community alerted the Police and Essien was arrested.
