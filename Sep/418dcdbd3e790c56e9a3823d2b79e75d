Nimi Thompson is kidnapped during a Pre-Campaign party and after a call from her abductors, it quickly becomes clear to her father- Livinus Thompson, that the motive is more personal than just money. According to Hauwa, Code Wilo was inspired by the 2019 elections, Godfatherisim in the polity and the need to portray a strong female character with a political ambition. “We basically shot this film thinking about how to influence the elections and encourage not to young to run. Our lead character is in her 30’s, she’s female and she’s running for Governor. I sat down with a group of investors and we decided to tell this story in the most relatable manner ” she said READ ALSO: Ramsey Nouah, AY, other celebrities grace ‘The Millions ‘movie premiere With a stellar cast including Eucharia Anunobi, Bikiya Graham-Douglas, Daniel Effiong, Yaw, Gabriel Afolayan, Zack Orji, Kalu Ikeagwu, Alex Usifo, Lateef Adedimeji among others, the movie takes its viewers through a twisted plot filled with gasps, suspense and surprises, reflecting the Nigerian political terrain.
