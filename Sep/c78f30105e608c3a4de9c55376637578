We are in Calabar in furtherance of that purpose and to support the government to address the issue of unemployment and of course underemployment. “This is our own modest way of contributing to the Nigerian youths because we believe in them. If the Nigerian youths were given the space and the opportunity their peers outside this country enjoy, they could also be globally competitive. The idea behind this is bridge the gap in terms of the skills they did not acquire while in school,” he said. “What we are doing here is called Youth Empowered Nigeria. It is part of our global initiative to empower youths between the ages of 18 and 30. The training started in October, 2017.

You have a situation where you have vacancies and you bring in a whole number of these young graduates and the skills that are required in the workplace they don’t have it.” According to him, any group that produces the best bankable business idea would be assisted to incorporate a company and provided with the initial funding they will require to actualise the business idea.
