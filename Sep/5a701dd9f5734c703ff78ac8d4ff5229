AC Milan’s nightmare start to the 2019/2020 Serie A season continued on Sunday when they fell to a 3-1 defeat at home (San Siro) to Fiorentina and had a man sent off. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1263031" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AC-Fiorentina.jpg?w=1248&amp;ssl=1 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Erick Pulgar put the San Siro’s visitors ahead from the penalty kick spot. Then, Gaetano Castrovilli doubled their lead, after Mateo Musacchio had been shown a straight red card for a rash challenge early in the second half. Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved a Federico Chiesa penalty kick. The third goal can be said to be delayed for a while until Fiorentina finally got it. Franck Ribery should be thanked for that but AC Milan also managed to return a goal when Rafael Leao pulled back a consolation for the hosts with 10 minutes remaining. This is their third consecutive defeat in just over a week heaps more pressure on embattled coach Marco Giampaolo and leaves them in 16th place on six points, one point above the relegation zone. The recent win by Fiorentina (the visiting team) have now earned their second win in a row to lift them up to ninth place on eight points. [NAN] Vanguard News Nigeria.
