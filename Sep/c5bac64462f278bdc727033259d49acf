Bello who stated this in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, CPS, Anthony Ogunleye on Wednesday, also appealed to residents to allow those efforts to succeed. “Malam Bello further informed residents that those South African business interests in the FCT are in partnership with Nigerian investors and are contributing to the economic development of the Territory. Attacking or vandalising them will ultimately have negative economic consequences for the Nigerian economy and employees of those organisations”, the statement added. The statement also assured South African nationals and business interests in the FCT of their safety adding that it was the pleasure of the FCT Administration to have them living and working in the nation’s Federal Capital Territory. While appealing to FCT residents to remain calm and go about their lawful activities, he warned that “law enforcement agencies have been mobilised to forestall any breakdown of law and order and that anybody instigating or participating in any acts of violence or vandalism will face the wrath of the law”.
