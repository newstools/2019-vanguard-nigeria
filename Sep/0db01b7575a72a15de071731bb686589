Speaking on the conference, Ummahani Ahmad Amin, Managing Partner at Metropolitan Law Firm & Convener of the Conference says “AICIF was established to highlight the practical solutions available to society via merging Islamic Finance with Conventional Finance practices. The dire need to financially include the excluded is pertinent considering that over 350 million African adults are unbanked, a whopping 66% of sub-Saharan Africa or 17% of the global total. “It then became imperative to have a gathering of leading minds that could proffer solutions to mitigate against an infrastructure deficit and boost financial inclusion.” The Convener announced that conference registration is now available for an early bird token of N150, 000 till the 15th of October, 2019 upon which registration shall revert to N200, 000. The Conference invites Ministers and other senior government officials with responsibility for finance and development of infrastructure; project sponsors / developers; institutional investors; local & international financial institutions; private equity firms; international development partners; technical, legal and financial advisers; technology suppliers; sector specialists & professional practitioners as well as business journalists to take advantage of access to a pool of participants and actors who shape the Islamic finance ecosystem in Africa.
