All will be sold with no reserve price. In February, Swiss prosecutors said they were dropping charges of financial wrongdoing against Teodorin Obiang Nguema but were confiscating the luxury cars as part of the case.

As vice president with responsibility for defence and security, Teodorin Obiang has a reputation for a playboy lifestyle. In October 2017, a Paris court handed him a three-year suspended jail term after convicting Obiang of siphoning off public money to buy assets in France. He was accused of spending more than 1,000 times his official annual salary on a six-storey mansion in a posh part of the French capital, a fleet of fast cars and artworks, among other assets. He was also given a suspended fine of €30m. In September, Brazilian media said that more than $16m in cash and luxury watches were seized by Brazilian Police and customs officers from luggage of a delegation accompanying Obiang on a private visit. Brazilian daily, O Estado de Sao Paulo, quoted a diplomatic source from Equatorial Guinea as saying the money was to pay for medical treatment Obiang was to undergo in Sao Paulo. The watches were for the “personal use” of the president’s son and were engraved with his initials, the report said. Obiang is reputedly on a fast track to succeed his father.
