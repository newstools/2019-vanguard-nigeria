While demanding an immediate stop to the bloodletting against innocent Nigerians, he called on the South African Government to commence the payment of adequate and commensurate compensation to the victims of the dastardly and unprovoked acts of aggression without delay.

Mandela preached peace, love and forgiveness during his lifetime. “We, therefore, encourage the youths to give peace a chance and allow Nigerians and other Africans resident in their country to live in harmony in the spirit of African oneness,” he said. He urged the South African authorities to urgently evolve both legal and policy instruments to permanently stop this acts of belligerence and open aggression against Nigerians. He also called on the leadership of the African Union (AU) to intervene and prevent needless hostilities between Nigeria and South Africa which may result if the prolonged attacks against Nigerians and their interests in the former apartheid enclave is not urgently halted. “It is time for the AU to walk the talk by invoking the necessary sections of its charter to stop this orgy of degradation and dehumanization against Nigerians. “The AU must prove its relevance by acting swiftly. They cannot afford to obfuscate by mouthing words while shying away from addressing the pogrom and genocide against innocent Nigerians legally residing in South Africa at this time. “They must act to prevent this unprovoked aggression from snowballing into unimaginable proportions on both sides. A stitch in time would save nine at this trying moments,” he said. Frank in a statement in Abuja further disclosed that he already had discussions with one of the leaders of opposition political parties in South Africa, Julius Malema, over the imbroglio and said that he would soon visit him to strategize on how to permanently end the hate induced violence against Nigerians in South Africa. “It is most unfortunate that Gen. Muhammadu Buhari and his ‘yahoo yahoo’ administration is clueless on how to protect Nigerians from this horrendous xenophobic onslaught against hapless citizens. “Since they are presently busy organizing worthless press conferences, I took the initiative and spoke with Julius Malema, one of the most respected voices in South Africa, and urged him to prevail on his people to sheath their swords and allow peace to reign. “I will be going to South Africa soon to visit Malema in order to evolve strategies and actions that would end this inhumanity being meted on innocent Nigerians by South Africans once and for all,” he said. He pleaded with Nigerians back home to exercise restraint in the face of this grievous acts of provocation emanating from South Africa. “If the South Africans are exhibiting madness, we must maintain our sanity by not attacking businesses owned by Nigerians here but operating under franchises owned by South Africans. “It is unfortunate that most business outlets now suffering reprisals in the country are 100 per cent owned by Nigerians operating under franchise. “Therefore any loss of lives or destruction of businesses in Nigeria in reaction to what is happening in South Africa would amount to double jeopardy for Nigeria,” Frank said. The political activist commiserated with families that have lost loved ones in the fracas. He also sympathized with Nigerians who have sustained injuries, lost property or businesses as a result of the attacks and urged them not to take laws into their hands but to allow justice to prevail.
