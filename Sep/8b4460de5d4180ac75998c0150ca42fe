Recently, we heard news of about 50 people been killed. In some countries, if such happened, the whole country will stop, take  stock and mourn. But here in Nigeria is a common thing and nobody cares, we see it as one of those things and move on. “We need to change security architecture of this country and our orientation. We need to understand as a person and government that if one citizen is attacked, killed or kidnapped, is a failure already. Government need to know that effectiveness is judged by what you prevent and not by what you detect.

So people take irrational decision because the system is over burdened. Police is ready to work but they don’t have enough resources, no enough capability, we need to question the kind of training and welfare they get,” he said. Ekhomu also urged Nigerians to be security conscious and ensure that their homes, streets or estates are safe, saying “if we work in that manner, we can survive the challenges. We can’t leave everything to government because we have a situation whereby the threat is too many, the attacks are too many and giving an impression that government is not doing anything.” On her part, the keynote speaker, Managing Director, Trans-World Security Systems Limited, Mrs. Victoria Ekhomu called on government to partner private security in addressing security issues. According to her, “whatever you are doing in the area of security, you must first carry out risk assessment. In doing so, you must identify your asset, know your core business, and look at how you can protect them. “Threat that can negatively affect the asset, what is the probability that the threat you identified will materialize. To do that you need to look at historical perspective, what has happened before, threat pattern, what happens to other neighbour.” Vanguard President  of Association of Industrial Security and Safety Operators of Nigeria,  AISSON Dr. Ona Ekhomu, yesterday, advised the Federal Government and security agencies to be on the alert and investigate returnees from Libya who claimed to be Nigerians, with a view to preventing   ISIS fighters from infiltrating the country.
