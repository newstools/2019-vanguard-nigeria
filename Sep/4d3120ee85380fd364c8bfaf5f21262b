That came at the end of a summer that saw movie revenue dip by 2 percent from last year, the Comscore website said. “Angel,” the third film in the franchise, stars Gerard Butler as a Secret Service agent wrongly accused of trying to kill the US president (Morgan Freeman). A relatively sedate movie weekend saw little change in the top five films. In second for a second straight week was Universal’s raunchy tween comedy “Good Boys,” which took in $9.2 million for three days ($11.6 million for four). In third, up one spot from last weekend, was Disney’s updated version of “The Lion King,” which pulled in $6.7 million ($9.2 million) in its seventh week out.
