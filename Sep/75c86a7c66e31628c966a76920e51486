Trying to switch and spice things up a little bit, another singer Trey Songz was introduced and 50 Cent’s rap verse reduced to just one, while some catchy rap lines used in the first version were dropped. This didn’t go down well with viewers who thought Trey Songz was not ‘street’ enough to understand what it takes to do an intro for such a ‘dark’ series. Many viewers resorted to rib-cracking memes to drive home their point and at a point, 50 Cent threatened to put out the next episode of the show without a theme song and have viewers thinking their TV was on mute.
