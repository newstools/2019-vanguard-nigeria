The warrior is prepared to die for his cause. That is what makes him so noble and that is why he will always have a special place in our hearts. May the spirit of the warrior fill us all and, like the true warriors that we are, when the angel of death comes may the Lord give us the strength and boldness to look him fearlessly in the face and treat him with the contempt and disdain that he deserves. May we never forget that he has lost his sting and that, by the power of Christ Jesus, he has been conquered and crushed.

The warrior will not go down without a fight. *Fani-Kayode served in the Obasanjo administration as Aviation Minister Vanguard The warrior is noble and strong.
