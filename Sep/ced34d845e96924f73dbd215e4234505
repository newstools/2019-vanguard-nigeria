The Facility will be upsized accordingly. Proceeds from the Facility will be used for general corporate purposes in accordance with AFC’s Establishment Agreement and the Charter.” Samaila Zubairu, President and CEO of AFC, commented: “Since joining AFC, one of my main goals has been to build a broad coalition of international investors.

Japan, in particular, is an important player and its guiding principles – quality growth, which focuses on inclusiveness, sustainability and resilience as well as human security, which focuses on capacity building – are completely aligned with AFC’s mission and vision.” Vanguard Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), a leading pan-African multilateral development finance institution and project developer, has issued its maiden Sukuk, the highest-rated ever Sukuk issuance from an African institution.
