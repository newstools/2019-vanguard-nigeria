“With the environment and people around me as inspiration and influence, my kind of sound is more of the Afro-fusion, dancehall delivery.” Jamal said he started his music career in 2010 as an underground singer and alongside his producer, Kodi, they formed a group—- Ko & Kodi. The group lasted for a year before they went solo due to their educational pursuits. In 2015 they linked up again and came up with an in-house studio, with Kodi the official producer. He made a comeback after releasing the song “The Link Up.” He further released “Stripper” with great visuals (2018) and followed up with few singles like “Nurse,” “Temptation” and other collaborations with the various artiste. Early this year, Jamal, who is the CEO of Ko Jamal Entertainment, released a song, “Success” and a video, which has gained massive airplay across the country and outside.
