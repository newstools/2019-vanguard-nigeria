HP Vice President, Distribution and Supplies Sales in charge of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Tiago Drummond-Borges, commended Task Systems for its consistently high level of product and service delivery. He said “Thank you for your cooperation in the recent Channel Partner Protection Audit, CPPA, of HP-branded and Samsung-branded supplies (“HP Supplies”) conducted in your company.

Consequently, we are glad to confirm your status as an HP partner as per your HP Partner Agreement.” Task Systems Managing Director, Olufunke Oduntan said the development has, once again, confirmed Task Systems as the undisputed choice when it comes to the supply of genuine ICT products.
