The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has written to the South East Governor, giving conditions and what they should do for peace to reign between them, on one side, and for the masses of South East to have trust and confidence in them. Writing through Mr. Aloy Ejimakor, who is the Special Counsel to IPOB and its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the Biafra agitating group said South East Governors denial of not briefed or otherwise complicit in the 2017 Operation Python Dance Military exercise in South East, which allegedly lead to loss of many lives, does not hold water. The letter, titled “Operation Python Dance: An Open Letter To Southeast Governors” which excluded Imo State Governor Rt. Hon. Emaka Ihedioha, which was made available to newsman by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, asked the South East governors to “instead of denying knowledge and involvement in the military exercise, they should gather together like they did before, to de-proscribe IPOB, and render sincere public apology for their alleged hurriedly resorting to a course of action that was wrong and dangerous in all ramifications.” South-East govs ban herdsmen, cattle movement among communities(Opens in a new browser tab) IPOB also told the South East Governors that before anybody believes their recent alleged contrite assertion that they were not briefed or otherwise complicit in the 2017 Operation Python Dance Military exercise, “they must write the National Assembly, informing it that it is now their reconsidered position that the President had violated the Constitution by launching combat military operations in their States and against their people without first declaring a ‘State of Emergency’ as required by Section 305 of the Constitution. The groups letter also urged the South East Governors to go back to the dialogue they were having with Mazi Kanu, back in early September 2017 which was allegedly unilaterally and summarily ended, and followed with the proscription that allegedly stigmatized the people of South East and watered ground for many Federal Government unconstitutional actions, including the declaration that millions of unarmed Igbo are terrorists. It also told the Governors that “once they you begin to earnestly take the steps, we have suggested for them, Ndigbo will reconsider, just as they will begin to see them as men possessing the requisite courage and sincerity to be accepted as their true leaders, only then will Ndigbo will come anywhere close to believing that they had nothing to do with Operation Python Dance and all its horrendous aftermaths. Only then will the bereaved families will be consoled over the undeserving deaths, sorrow and destruction against their ones.” “Before anybody believes your recent contrite assertions that you were not briefed or otherwise complicit in the 2017 Python Dance military operations that claimed the precious lives of your innocent citizens, you need to do more, including but not limited to the following recommendations: “You must, as you did in September 2017, gather together and de-proscribe IPOB; and then render a heart-felt, sincere public apology for hurriedly resorting to a course of action that was wrong and dangerous in all of its ramifications.
