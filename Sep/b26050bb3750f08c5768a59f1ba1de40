Mr Kayode Ibrahim, engineer supervising the project on behalf of the Ministry of Works while reacting to concerns raised by some road users told Newsmen that swift actions would be taken to avert gridlock. In an early morning interview, some traders from Mowe market had told Newsmen that activities of Local Government officials collecting tolls from articulated vehicles on Kara Bridge worsened the gridlock. The traders, who were on their way to the popular Ketu fruit market, appealed to both the Lagos and Ogun State governments to seek alternative ways of collecting the toll during the construction to reduce hardship. The road users and other motorists also called for strategies to reduce the number of pedestrians crossing the highway at the Isheri Junction intersection where the diversion merges with traffic on the Lagos side.

Ibrahim also said that the ministry will contact the FRSC and LASTMA on possible solutions to the pedestrian crossing on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.

Responding to the work on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ibrahim told Newsmen that high-quality construction materials were being used to reconstruct the highway because of the huge vehicular volume on the axis. “Usually, sub-base materials, depending on the location, are lateritic; we use laterite or sand, but on this project, the design of the pavement structure is such that sub base is made up of 200 mm thickness of crushed rock to make it stronger,” he said.
