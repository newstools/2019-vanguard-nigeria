He appreciated the Igbos for being very enterprising and determined to succeed by penetrating the nooks and crannies of the country for business exploits. “You should use the same spirit of enterprise to promote peaceful co-existence among Nigerians, in all that you are doing. “You have done well to keep Nigeria together.
