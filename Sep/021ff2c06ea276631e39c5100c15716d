Yes! You can be all you want to be as a home maker and a career woman. What this means is that you can take care of the home front and, at the same time, have time to take care of your beauty.<img class="size-full wp-image-1250368 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=640%2C487&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="487" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=768%2C584&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=1024%2C779&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=58%2C44&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=255%2C194&amp;ssl=1 255w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=171%2C130&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?resize=560%2C426&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pretty.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Being a homemaker does not change who you are! You can’t end all the work of being a woman in a day. Hence, it is high time you create time to take care of yourself. Whether you are a career woman, who go out as early as six in the morning and return at night, or a business woman, who go out very early too and come back late, or a house wife who stay at home doing one chore or the other having no time to take your bath till night (not right), you can do all that and still keep your beauty. That is eating your cake and, at the same time, having it – all round success. Assembly urges Anambra indigenes to come home, invest(Opens in a new browser tab) How? Love yourself as you love your home. An old saying goes, “Men may work from sun to sun, but a woman’s work is never done”. This saying stands true, especially for Africa women who have no time of their own. They work 24/7 to be sure their home is in order but never think of making sure their own lives are in order. Women are quick to forget that their bodies are their home and temple. A little time set aside for yourself isn’t too much to make you lose that customer in your shop. It won’t make your children wayward not to talk of making your husband to look outside. Rather, it enhances your beauty and gives you long life to enjoy your labour as home makers. It doesn’t matter the time of the day or the day of the week that you can spare, take the time and the steps to pamper yourself. Remember that you, as a whole, are what you are stuck with for life. Life is not about the color pink, but all sides of the rainbow. So treat yourself well and like yourself. Self-care may not necessarily mean attending some extravagant spa day which is in vogue now, but rather being able to identify when you need to slow down and perhaps cancel that spa day. Here is a way to pamper yourself this week Practice some self – love Look in the mirror and list everything about yourself that you love from your hair to your toes. Tell yourself that you are amazing and wonderfully made and that you deserve to be loved. For example, your hair, eye balls, face, eye lids, eye lashes, lips, teeth, smiles, boobs, rump or bum, celebrate all what you love about yourself and walk tall with them. Then, consider the things you would like to improve, without thinking negatively about those things. For instance, instead of thinking, ‘I have rough face”, tell yourself, “I am going to take time to get information on how to make my face smooth and glow”. Pouting your lips that many women think is for small girls is another way of making you happy as you practice self love in front of your mirror or take several ‘selfie’ with your  hand phone if you have one. Just go ahead and make yourself happy and be in tune with fashion trend. Practice it. How? *Position your lips and teeth together.
