Speaking to the media in Lagos, Baywood founder,  Emperor Chris Ibe explained that  the programme which is slated for 2020 will be driven by the trio of African Union, ECOWAS and BF to train youths to participate in governance with a view to taking leadership roles in the continent. He said: “Beginning from next year, 10,000 youths from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, gender and academic disciplines under the auspices of the BF will participate in a special internship programme for a period of 12 months.

To this end, he said road blocks in their paths should be removed. While lauding President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the not-too-young-to-run bill, he said that part of the challenges identified by BF, were the abandonment of youths, lack of engagement and collaboration with youths. His words: “All these have culminated in the lack of opportunities for youths to actively participate in governance. These problems are lamentable, anti-democratic, including the exclusionist disposition of African leaders who capitalise on ethnic, religious as well as socio-economic divisions in their countries to perpetuate themselves in office.” Vanguard African Leaders on Tuesday unanimously endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari to champion the fight against corruption in the African Union.
