The recent closure of the Nigerian borders with West African neighbors might hamper the implementation of the free trade movement within the sub-region of the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS), officials said. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1188678" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790-300x176.jpg?resize=300%2C176&#038;ssl=1" alt="ECOWAS" width="300" height="176" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790.jpg?resize=58%2C34&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790.jpg?resize=260%2C153&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790.jpg?resize=200%2C117&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790.jpg?resize=560%2C329&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ECOWAS-Headquarters-in-Abuja-e1555411214790.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
Moustapha Lo, the regional bloc’s parliament speaker, said this while addressing parliamentarians at the ongoing 2nd Extraordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament in Monrovia. Whilst seeking a reversal of the decision by the Nigerian government, Lo said in a statement on Tuesday.
Lo said that this border closure would continue to pose a threat to the implementation of the protocol on the free movement of persons within the region. The parliament speaker noted that this development came at a time when Africa was working to intensify efforts for the effective abolition of barriers within the member-states. The Nigerian authorities had closed the borders with Benin about a month ago and Niger more recently, as a measure toward tacking the challenge of smuggling. The ECOWAS parliament said this is a hindrance to the achievement of the regional bloc’s main objective, which includes “achieving the creation of a prosperous, borderless West African region where peace and harmony prevail”. “The ECOWAS Parliament calls for compliance with Community provisions and thus calls for the reopening of borders and a coordinated fight against smuggling in the region,” the statement said. “The root causes of this recurrent situation must be studied with a view to finding a permanent solution.” It further urged the Nigerian government to find a permanent solution to the challenge of smuggling, rather than closing the borders, which, the ECOWAS parliament said, was not a lasting solution.
