But what I’m going to say is that the common denominator in all of this is knowledge and hard work. You have to know what you are doing; if it’s street you want to do, know the street very well and then work hard. Opportunities will come but they will not fly in through your window in the middle of the night. How my mother saw my future – TerryTheVoice(Opens in a new browser tab) You have to go out there, you have to be gingered, and you have to shove your music down people’s throats. A lot of people will say ‘but we don’t have money’. Money is an important tool but money is not a hindrance. When you go to the point when you’re ready to work hard, shame will leave your body system. It’s that hunger that will drive you. What I always say to artistes that are coming up is that irrespective of the genre of music you find yourself doing, just continue to make sure that you are the best version of yourself and you work hard,” she said. Vanguard The challenge is the same challenge every upcoming artiste face everywhere in the world. The challenge of funding. You know what I mean. You have to go work for yourself and whatever you earn you pour into the passion that you have.
