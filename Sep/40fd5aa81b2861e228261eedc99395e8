According to the Council, the mention of Miyetti Allah is a sad and painful reminder of the unprovoked and brutal destruction of lives and properties in Agatu in neighboring Benue State and Ogani – Enigu, Kogi State in 2018. It also recalled with nostalgia the violent abduction, torturing and subsequent gruesome murder of a traditional ruler in Ogwashi-Ukwu, Delta State and the mass killings, rapings, and arson in Nimbo, Enugu State, in 2018, saying these havocs by Miyatti Allah are still fresh in the people’s memory. The statement reads: The expanded campaign council of the Peoples’ Democratic Party in Kogi State and the Engr. Musa Wasa campaign organisation welcomes the endorsement of the second term ambition of outgoing governor, Yahaya Bello by not less a group but the Kogi State chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria. “The Council notes that whereas it is the prerogative of the Kogi State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress to shop for and purchase endorsements wherever available, it is imperative for the party and its flag-bearer to realize that Kogites are freeborn and that Kogi State is not a conquered territory or an annex of the ancestral homeland of the Miyetti Allah. “For the sake of history and posterity, the Council fully acknowledges that whereas the Miyetti Allah is a trade group that has a lot counting in its favour, the group also comes along with baggages which are troubling and of grave concern to the good people of Kogi State. “The campaign council of the Peoples Democratic Party in Kogi State wished that the Kogi State chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria remains apolitical but in consideration of the reality that some elements in the group have chosen to be meddlesome, notice is hereby conveyed to the All Progressives’ Congress that eligible voters in Kogi state are predominantly the youth, men and women of Kogi State. “The Council, therefore, wishes to remind the ruling All Progressives Congress that to the unbowed youth of Kogi State, the mention of Miyetti Allah is a sad and painful reminder of the unprovoked and brutal destruction of lives and properties in Agatu in neighboring Benue State and Ogani – Enigu, Kogi State in 2018. “We equally remind the All Progressives Congress that to the indomitable men of Kogi State, the mention of Miyetti Allah is a rude and shocking reminder of the violent abduction, torturing and subsequent gruesome murder of a traditional ruler in Ogwashi-Ukwu, Delta State in 2018. “We finally remind the All Progressives Congress that to the irrepressible women of Kogi State, the mention of Miyetti Allah has so far remained a disrespectful reminder of the mass killings, rapings, and arson that was visited on the people of Nimbo in neighboring Enugu State in 2018.”  Vanguard The tribal leaders pointed out that the Benue anti-open grazing law does not stultify the culture, movement or economic interests of any person or group of persons, including members of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore Fulani Association June 3, 2018 In "News" THE National Economic Council, NEC, Thursday met at the Presidential Villa and appointed Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State to head a committee that will meet with the leadership of the Miyatti Allah so as to find a lasting solution to the farmers/herdsmen clashes.
