Speaking, Ochinke said the police have been evading service of suit and that the order granted by the court will enable him send the suit through courier which they (Police) cannot reject or claim ignorance of. He also stated that the charge handed by the police to his client while still in their detention does not amount to arraignment since he was not taken before any court where the charges were read to him. The matter was adjourned to Wednesday, for the police to produce Jalingo in court. Meanwhile, the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, CDHR, has called for the unconditional release of the journalist, Jalingo. CDHR President, Mr Malachy Ugwunmmadu, in a statement noted that the charge against Agba was just filed on August 30, 2019, several weeks after his adoption without a detention order and in violation of his rights to liberty and movement under Ss. 34&40 of the 1999 Constitution respectively. Ugwunmmadu said: “The charges filed are clearly by  private legal practitioners who did not disclose their sources of authority in filing charges against Mr. Jalingo either as police officers or legal  practitioners acting on behalf of the CP or IG except their claim as “Legal/Prosecution“ whatever that means. PRAWA lauds Buhari on Correctional Service Act(Opens in a new browser tab) “I do not think they are sufficiently covered by the Supreme Court authorities in FRN vs Osahon(2006)2 S.C (Pt.11); (2006)5 NWLR(Pt.973)361 or the earlier case of Sunday Olusemo vs COP (1998) 11 NWLR. Assuming without conceding that they’re also police officers(who are also legal practitioners) their situations are made worse in terms of filing and prosecuting those charges by virtues of S.106 of the ACJA 2015.” “I understand that Cross Rivers State, like Lagos State, has promulgated their own ACJL. The well established principle of law by the Court of Appeal in Arthur Nwankwo v State since 1985 renders counts 1 and 2 patently indefensible. Counts 3 and 4 loosely refer to him(Agba) as an associate of Cde. Sowore as though Sowore is already a convict, an ex convict, fugitive or an outlaw forgetting that Sowore is still a free citizen of Nigeria in whose favour the presumption of innocence under S. 36(6) still applies while Jalingo retains his right to freely associate.” Vanguard CALABAR—A High Court sitting in Calabar, Cross River  State, yesterday granted permission to the state Prosecutor to file criminal proceedings against Dr Eyo Mensah of the University of Calabar and five students over alleged certificate racketeering and forgery.
