The spokesperson of the aggrieved council members Bernard Friday said the chairman of the local government , Andrew Osigbe forced them out of their park and did not provide them with any parks for operations just as he said the harassment and intimidation of the two councilors who he identified as Ohilebo Francis of Ward 2 and his counterpart in Ward 3 Hon Francis culminated in their suspension from the legislative arm. They appealed to Obaseki and the state house of assembly to come to their rescue. But Osigbe debunked the allegation saying they are only trying to paint the leadership of the local government in bad light.

He said the allegation indicating that they are not supporting Obaseki “is a rumour by mischief makers and disgruntled politicians who left the APC to secure political benefits in other political parties and now want to come back through the back door using some members of the APC. “It is on record that we have worked very hard to secure victory at the last general elections where we won overwhelmingly and  declared with one voice that Owan is one and we are APC.” He said the transport workers were operating in an authorized place and were told to relocate while he said the crisis in the legislative arm that led to the suspension of the two councilors was being handed by the chairman. “The Chairman and his team will not give in to cheap blackmail and propaganda from those that are being used by some disgraced and disgruntled  politicians to launch back into APC.” Vanguard National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, Ika South chapter, Delta State, has called on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, of the state and security agencies, to investigate activities of two former leaders of the union, bent on inflicting mayhem on innocent citizens in the local government.
