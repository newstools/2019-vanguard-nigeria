When two brothers fight, strangers reap the harvest- Igbo Proverb It is time to take a step back and reflect. Things are getting out of hand, in fact, it has been getting out of hand for far too long. Years too long. Far too many people have died, too much bad blood and a fractured relationship that goes back decades. Now our Ambassador to South Africa has been recalled. Nigerian musicians are boycotting South Africa and African countries are withdrawing from events in South Africa.  Our president and his fellow African Heads of State are registering their displeasure.  The markets are beginning to feel the impact of the conflict. Money, makes the big corporations sit up and take notice.  Strange that the western world refuses to make mention of the conflict, is it not news worthy?  It is hardly making the western news. That speaks volumes. Presumably, African lives do not mean much as long as it does not make a dent in the profit margin. Incredible how Africans are foreigners in Africa like they are in the rest of the world, and Europeans are experts in Africa and not foreigners?  Do you get that picture? Would diplomacy work to stem the hatred or could South Africa feel the fall out of her close neighbours?  It would be unfortunate,if this is not resolved.  We cannot afford to foster self hatred.  It plays into the hand of the oppressors. It is no skin off their nose. They wrote the script on divide and conquer. Understandably,  there have been talks of bad Africans bringing drugs into South Africa. It is too simplistic.  And besides,there are Nigerian doctors and nurses in South African hospitals . According to Naledi Pandor, South African Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that Nigeria should keep its citizens who are into drug peddling, human trafficking and other vices from coming into her country; ‘She said that South Africa needed the help of the Federal Government of Nigeria to curb crimes in their country, as she said that South Africans believe that Nigerians were into drug peddling, human trafficking and other vices that hurt their nation. I’m sure South Africans were into drugs before Nigerians came. This is not to say, that the problem of Nigerian drug dealers doesn’t exist. It does. The South African authorities are more than capable of dealing with criminals regardless of their nationalities. The Killing Spree: Timeline of Nigerians killed in South Africa(Opens in a new browser tab) We are one. We are Africans. Like most Sub Saharan African countries, Nigeria and  South Africa have ties that go deeper than deep. History shows that Nigeria stood by Black South Africans  in the dark days of apartheid in cash and in support, in protest and in sanctions as well as providing haven for activists and young South Africans. Here are some of the historical facts: The role that Nigeria played in breaking down apartheid  can not be underplayed, Nigeria was instrumental and we, as young Nigerians were fully aware and our governments encouraged us to keep up the fight to dismantle the heinous apartheid regime. We were beyond joy also when, Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa and Apartheid was finally dismantled. So these may be lost on some South Africans who feel that Nigerians along side others so called ‘African’ foreigners should leave South Africa . They believe that these foreigners are taking their jobs and using their resources. Sounds familiar? Yes, of course, if it were an European country and the foreigners were black Africans.  You do not expect it from fellow black Africans? No, well, No.  So what is going on? South Africa has a problem  and the problem is not fellow black Africans, not by a long stretch of the imagination. It is with the minority white south Africans who hold over 80%of the wealth and despite, the death of apartheid (on paper), the shift in wealth and power remains with the white south Africans and the black south Africans have not experienced the promise of an equal south Africa. Understandably, the majority of black Africans are tired and frustrated that their  lives have not changed in spite of the promise. So while, the disgruntled are focussing on a small number of Africans ekeing out a living, the status quo does not change at all, the rich 2% continue to live a life of privilege  and distraction benefits them .  While the poor blames other africans, the  owners of the South African multinationals, think supermarkets, cell phones operators, and companies have are steadily making inroads into other African countries, they are African after all! They are making a killing and they make no changes to the lives of black south Africans. They are hardly investing in south Africa but they continue to benefit from the country so nothing’s changed. Of course. Other Africans in south Africa have gone into south Africa to make a life, to the resentment of black africans. How dear Jonny come lately, come in here and swans around like he owns the place?   The bad blood runs through the neighbourhood where poverty no longer understands logic but gratification.  They can not get the rich, then get the poor foreigner, who happens to be an African.  It is a convenience. So why the repudiation and violence? This is a country that is historically steeped in violence. The oppressed have learnt the ways of the oppressors.  It is shocking, absolutely shocking. Having said this, we should also remember, that Nigerians are hard workers and whatever they find themselves, they will make it work.  They did exactly that, and their success did not go  unnoticed. Nigerians work hard and play hard. This might have rubbed the native south africans the wrong way. It still did not warrant violence and death. Equally they have assaulted Zimbabweans, Somalis, Zambians and other southern Africans. Safe to say not all South Africans want black Africans out. Fire brand, Julius Malema has suggested that people’s anger should rather be directed at white people while blaming them for the chaos. He took to Twitter page on  the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader accused the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party of protecting white people who he claims own their wealth and don’t want to share with them. He said;“Our anger is directed at wrong people. Like all of us, our African brothers & sisters are selling their cheap labour for survival,” African Jour  The owners of our wealth is white monopoly capital; they are refusing to share it with us & the ruling party #ANC protects them. One Africa is possible’ In another tweet, Malema also appeared to blame white people for the ongoing crisis. :“I think these whites must for a second keep quiet because we are dealing with a mess created by them. They are the ones who created this situation by telling us that we are poor & unemployed because ”foreigners” took our jobs. We are fighting for cramps [sic].” Trevor Noah, South African comedian and presenter echoed the same. There are reprisals in Nigeria aimed at Shoprite stores, which are seen as a symbol of everything that’s wrong with South Africa’s engagement with the continent. And African governments — usually so slow to condemn the electoral fraud or human rights abuses of their counterparts — have not been shy to criticise South Africa, including a stinging rebuke from the new chair of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat.  So for those who are quick to burn and destroy south African businesses  in Nigeria. Remember, that those who gets hurts most are the Nigerian workers not the owners of these businesses. Besides, those who are quick to pillage and loot the supermarket  have got ulterior motives . There are not helping the victims. Two wrongs don’t make a right.  Before we start playing the victim card, remember what  Nigerians did to the Ghanaians( we still have Ghana must go bags). That is for another day.
