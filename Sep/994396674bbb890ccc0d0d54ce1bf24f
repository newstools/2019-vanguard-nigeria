US Open winner Bianca Andreescu, 200th in the world rankings a year ago, leapt into the top five on Monday, while Ashleigh Barty knocked Naomi Osaka off top spot. Eliminated in the first qualifying round in New York a year ago, Andreescu rose 10 places to number five after beating Serena Williams in the final on Saturday. The 19-year-old Canadian is one place behind Osaka, whose defence of her US title ended in the quarterfinals. Barty was also knocked out in the last eight but, since she was knocked out in the fourth round in 2018, increased her ranking points total. The Australian is just over 400 points ahead of the Czech Karolina Pliskova, who climbed one place to second.
