It is baffling why herdsmen are gradually transforming FUTO premises into a cattle colony”, Nnabuihe said. Answering a question, the Registrar said that the institution has written to the Chairman, Cattle Owners Association, Obinze, complaining about the development. Part of the letter, dated September 4, 2019, and copied to heads of security agencies in the state, read: “I write on the authority of the Vice Chancellor, to draw your attention to the incessant invasion of herdsmen and their cattle on the campus of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri”, Nnabuihe said. He reminded the Cattle Owners Association Chairman that government prohibited the group from grazing on university lands and environs. “The sensitive nature of grazing on campus and the obvious tension it breeds among students, may ultimately lead to clashes, if not curbed. This is given the current precarious security challenges associated with open grazing”, Nnabuihe said. The University then requested the Chairman, to urgently intervene by directing the herdsmen to desist from grazing within the University campus.
