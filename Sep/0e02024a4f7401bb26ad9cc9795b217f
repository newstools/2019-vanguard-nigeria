Military personnel were involved in obtaining weapons, the statement said. According to a BBC report paraphrasing the Ghana’s government authority, the group were aiming to recruit and radicalise a base of young people. A stash of weapons and ammunition was found following 15 months of surveillance. This included six pistols, three smoke grenades, 22 IEDs, two AK47 magazines and one long knife. Computer equipment, a voice recorder and a Ghanaian passport were also among the list of items seized. Security analysts have downplayed the claims of a coup plot, saying the group lacked the weapons and mass movement required. The government statement said the three men arrested, named as Frederick Yao Mac-Palm, Ezor Kafui and Bright Allan Debrah Ofosu, had set up a group targeting young people. Known as Take Action Ghana (TAG), the aim was to mobilise the youth for “nation-building”. But this was a guise for their intention to “build a support base of youth, and radicalise them against the political authority in Ghana”. The alleged coup plotters, one of whom is a doctor, had started procuring weapons and improvised explosive devices.  The statement said they procured some chemicals that were to be used to concoct weapons from a hospital. The government has also accused military personnel of plotting to obtain weapons. The BBC reporter in the capital, Accra, said that although there is a lot of dissatisfaction in Ghana at the moment, this alleged plot still comes as a surprise.
