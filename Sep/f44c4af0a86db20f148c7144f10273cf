The national chairman said that the meeting also enabled the party to know the huge debts of salary arears and projects inherited by Gov. Bello led-government from his predecessor. “The conversation also enables us to amplify the fact that Gov Bello met huge debt burden. “Debts not only in terms of salary arears not paid by predecessor but debt of contracts allegedly awarded  some paid for job not done and we said he (governor) should try to get some of those projects completed,” he said. Bello commended the National Working Committee of the party for inviting all its  Kogi governorship aspirants to trash out their differences to ensure party’s victory in the upcoming Nov. 16 governorship election in the state. He assured the aspirants that he would carry them along in his campaign and governance to better the lives of people of the state.

We gave a level-playing field to PDP and other political parties to carry out their activities freely within the state. “They moved round the nooks and crannies, all the aspirants in other political parties moved round the nooks and crannies of Kogi state. “I conducted the security people round the Stadium and went round the stadium and my security chiefs in Kogi  were very excellent and up and doing as far as Kogi is concerned,” he said.
