He said that the sub region had been plagued by various crises for more than a decade. According to him, the most worrying is the menace of terrorism which is rampant in many Member States, citing the case of farmers and herdsmen attack across the Region. The Speaker recalled that on April 26, 2018 in Abuja, a specific meeting of Ministers responsible for Security and Agriculture/Livestock was held, preceded by a meeting of ECOWAS Experts on conflicts between livestock farmers and farmers. Cisse-Lo said that unfortunately, while ECOWAS, the international community and Member States are working to combat this scourge, crises between various communities are also worsening. He said that at the end of the ongoing Parliamentary seminar, strategies of curbing and bringing inter-community conflict to an end will be realised. Earlier, Dr. Bhofal Chambers Speaker of the Liberia House of Representatives said that efforts by the regional body to bring about socioeconomic synergy between Members of ECOWAS states must be considered. He explained that the efforts must take cognisance of the respective cultures and values of its peoples.

He further urged the Parliament to consider the sociology of the people of the sub-region, ranging from their traditions, culture, religions and their respective economies to ensure a proper policy prescription that suits their well-being. Bhofal said that as the region moves more closely together, the means and mechanisms for ECOWAS citizens to live more peacefully could not be over emphasised.
