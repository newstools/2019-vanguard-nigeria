Wants compensation for victims THE Federal Government on Tuesday said that Nigeria will not retaliate to the xenophobic attacks against her citizens in South Africa. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama stated this while speaking with State House correspondents after leading outgoing Ukraine and Sri Lanka ambassadors to Nigeria to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said that the Nigeria government had proposed to the South African government to compensate Nigerians that were victims of the attacks. <img class="size-full wp-image-102460 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Nigeria-map1.jpg?resize=400%2C325&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nigeria, Xenophobic" width="400" height="325" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Nigeria-map1.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Nigeria-map1.jpg?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The Minister further said that the Federal Government was also considering sending security agencies to South Africa to work closely with the South African police force over the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians. According to him, “We have registered our strong protest to the government of South Africa but most importantly, we have put forward to the south African government what we think will make a big difference.

He said,” We don’t believe that two wrongs make right, I think in terms of revenge on those kinds of attack is not what we are looking forward to. The South African government has assured us that they are doing everything possible to address the situation, that they are equally exasperated by the whole event. We believe that with that goodwill we may be able to work together to put in place these mechanisms that would make a difference.” He said that the Special Envoy that had been dispatched to South Africa to meet the country’s President would go with the two issues of compensation and deployment of Nigeria Police to be stationed at the Office of Nigeria High Commission. He said,” It is just those two key issues, the compensation payment and what security mechanism be put in place to make sure that this kind of attacks does not recur. We need to have a viable mechanism in place. “As I have said, one of the possibilities that we are proposing is to have some Nigerian security operatives working with the South African police and attached to the Nigerian High Commission in South Africa.” Vanguard Following the resurfaced xenophobic attacks against Nigerians and other nationals living in South Africa, the Senate, during plenary on Tuesday, resolved to send a strong delegation of Nigerian legislatures to the South African parliament to put an end to the ugly trend.
