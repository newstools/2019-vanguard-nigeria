Since the show started, the Saturday parties have moved from boring and not engaging to full of fights and drama until the new, unexpected turn. On social media, fans argued that the calmness was due to the recent strikes doled out to erring housemates in recent times. Tacha and Ike, who are usually the most easily provoked, have two strikes each with the BBNakna fate hanging on a thread while Mercy has one strike. With the taming of these three housemates and warning issued to Seyi and the others, Saturday party glided through with fanfare and considerable drinking.
