Alhaji Aminu Nadari, Chairman of the local relief distribution committee told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Daura on Tuesday, that all the affected victims had been provided with relief materials which included bags of rice, beans, maize, blankets, mattresses, cooking oil, roofing sheets, ceiling and rubber mats. He added that the level and degree of damaged suffered by an individual victim determined the number of relief materials he received. “We are meticulous in the entire process as no one is left out.’’ Nadari noted that the remaining 800 victims would be covered when the committee receives the remaining two tracks of the relief materials, expected to arrive “any moment from now.” He called on the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the materials and warned that the agency would not condone any act of sabotage.
