The Nigerian Ambassador to Burkina Faso, Ramatu Ahmed says no fewer than 10,000 Nigerian girls are forced into prostitution in Burkina Faso.<img class="size-full wp-image-938894 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/prost-e1518268120308.png?resize=412%2C274&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="412" height="274" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Ahmed disclosed this in an Interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN)  in Ouagadougou on Monday She said the  victims of sex-trade were mainly underage girls kept in appalling conditions in Ouagadougou and in mining camps across the West African country. Ahmed who had been in Burkina Faso since August 2017,  said  that over 200 Nigerian girls had been voluntarily repatriated this year. According to the Ambassador,  many of the girls who were promised jobs in the country and Europe by the human traffickers are not willing to return home. The spate of human trafficking here in Burkina Faso is a big concern to the embassy because at present, we have nothing  less than 10,00 Nigerian girls who have been trafficked into Burkina Faso as commercial sex workers  and most of these girls are underage, most left school and are roaming about doing commercial sex work in Burkina Faso.

She said the Embassy is partnering with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) office in Ouagadougou to assist in the voluntary repatriation of some of the victims of human trafficking. “200 girls have been repatriated to Nigeria  by the embassy , this is apart from the ones that runs to the churches , some to other Civil society Organisations(CSOs) and the International Organisations on Migration (IOM). In fact, the IOM is complaining to the embassy that most its money meant for West Africa is used to repatriate Nigerian girls back home and they are complaining that with time, they would not be able to cope with the number. “So if the embassy alone have repatriated 200 girls, you can imagine how many girls the IOM has repatriated and  the reason they are complaining. Ahmed also appealed to Nigerian parents and guardians to monitor their children and wards more closely and not to be swayed by promises of greener pastures abroad. “I am pleading with  Nigerian parents that they should know what their children are doing, most of the girls said  that their parents don;t know what they are  here  and some will tell us that their parents  know and some will say that they were sent by either their father, mother, Uncle. “This is problem that emanates from the family, for the girls, i  wish to tell them that anybody they see that comes to tell them that he is taking then to somewhere, either employed as hair dressers or work in the shop, these are human traffickers. Anybody that will tell them not work in Nigeria but to move outside is simply a human trafficker and they should be weary of such persons. she said It will be recalled that the U.S. Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report (TIR) 2019, Burkina Faso is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.
