A statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr Peter Afunanya, made it clear that the service was however on the trail of the masterminds of the plot. The statement said: “The Department of State Services (DSS) wishes to reiterate its earlier alert to the nation of plans by subversive groups and individuals to undermine national security, peace and unity in the country. “These elements are determined to exploit political differences and other occurrences, within and outside the country, to destabilize the nation. They also initiate narratives to deepen their subversive objectives so as to achieve preferred illegal outcomes. “The aim is to set the country on fire as well as inflame passions across ethnic and religious divides with expected violent consequences. “The DSS, however, deplored the deliberate use of fake news and unsubstantiated information by mischievous and well-placed Nigerians spread across social media platforms to deceive and incite sections of the populace to civil unrest. It said: “While condemning the unpatriotic and misguided activities of these anti-social elements, the Service equally warns them to desist forthwith from their unholy acts as the full weight of the law will be brought against them. “In the same vein, citizens are enjoined to remain law-abiding, peaceful and report any suspicions likely to inhibit public safety to appropriate authorities.” It, however, assured Nigerians that it would at all times remain committed in its pursuit of national stability in line with its statutory mandate of protecting the country against crimes and threats to its internal security.  The Department of State Services (DSS) has decried the increasing use of fake and unsubstantiated information on social media platforms to deceive and incite the public.
