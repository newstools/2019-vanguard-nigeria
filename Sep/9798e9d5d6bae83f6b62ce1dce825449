Hundreds of millions of Opera Mini users can now transfer images, videos and audio files between nearby devices at super high speeds, without being limited by slow mobile networks or using their mobile data. With the new, fast and secure offline file sharing feature in Opera Mini, there is no longer any need to download a dedicated file sharing app. The native offline file sharing feature in Opera Mini can transfer files at speeds of up to 300MB/s, making it the fastest solution for file sharing. “Opera Mini is the mobile browser of choice for more than a hundred million people,” said Jørgen Arnesen, Head of Marketing and Distribution at Opera. “With the new offline file sharing feature, Opera Mini users can now choose to share files at high speeds with people in their proximity, without worrying about low speeds or expensive mobile data”. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1259392" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/OMA_FS_Banner2_v3.gif?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" data-recalc-dims="1" /> How offline file sharing works Offline file sharing and its accelerated file transfer speed are made possible through a direct Wi-Fi connection which Opera Mini establishes seamlessly with nearby devices.
