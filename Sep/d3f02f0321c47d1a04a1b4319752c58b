The junior engineers brought onboard are too much than it could need. “We now have significantly more junior talent than we are able to place.” About 25 per cent of its talent (mid-level and senior engineers) are outsourced. The company claimed this made the necessary strategy to continually grow become more conspicuous. “As a result, we’ve come to the conclusion that Andela’s next phase of growth requires a strategic shift in how we think about talent.” On the other hand, the company will be hiring an additional 700 experienced engineers by the end of 2020 to efficiently handle the demand for experts by its partners. “We will hire another 700 experienced engineers by the end of 2020 in order to keep up with demand from our partners. “To continue creating junior engineering talent at scale, we will invest in the Andela Learning Community, through which we’ve already trained more than 30,000 learners in software engineering fundamentals.” Andela is one of the engineering organisations in Africa with more than 1500 engineers and partners with over 200 technology companies worldwide.
