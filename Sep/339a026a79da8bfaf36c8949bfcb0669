Some of the Kada Queens players told NAN that the state government which owns the team have completely neglected them. “We are not suspending our protest until we get paid our entitlements,” one of the players said on condition of anonymity. “There is no hope for the second phase of the Zenith Bank league for us, because we have not received any allowance since last year. “They are always begging us and giving fake promises without fulfilling any. “We always do our best to make them proud during league season but we don’t get appreciated.” Another player said: “Some of us are coming from distant places to play and cannot continue to play without allowance. “Apart from our personal needs, we also have parents and siblings to cater for. “We don’t trust the management any longer as previous promises to offset the allowances have gone unheeded. “If the management value our welfare and the interest of the team, they would do everything possible to settle our allowances.” The fear of most of the players is that the club management will not pay the outstanding entitlements once the league comes to an end.

NAN reports that efforts to get the reaction of the state Director of Sports, Yakubu Ibrahim, was not successful as he was said to be attending a promotion examination.(NAN) VANGUARD Worried by the waves of killings, armed banditry and kidnapping in the state, residents of Katsina State including prominent Islamic scholars have on Thursday gone spiritual by organizing a special prayer session to overcome the current security faced in the state.
