The programme had 6 breakout sessions with 3 networking sessions. Speaking on why Fidelity bank embarked on this result oriented business empowerment, the Managing Director/CEO, Nnamdi Okonkwo said that, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have continued to contribute their fair share to the development of Nigeria.
