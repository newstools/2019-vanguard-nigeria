Hw said: “I want to observe with pleasure that in the last three months, the FIRS has been the major contributor to the Federation Account. The average contribution from the FIRS in the last three months is about 59.7 percent. In other words, more than half of the revenue shared to the three tiers of government comes from the FIRS. So, I thank you for that effort.” The RMAFC boss said the visit was to ensure that RMAFC commissioners and members of management understand the revenue landscape and familiarise themselves with major stakeholders of the Commission. “We are here to familiarise ourselves with your activities, to know areas of collaboration, your challenges, which we will also help to pass to the Federal Government. We also want to know where we can be of help. We are all working for the same government and our work is collaborative,” he added. On his part, FIRS Chairman, Mr. Tunde Fowler, stated that FIRS would continue do its best to generate revenue to fund the three tiers of government.
