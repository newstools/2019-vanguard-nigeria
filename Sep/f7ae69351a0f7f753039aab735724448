So excited about getting on that #SuperBowlLIV” stage tweeted Shakira. The NFL confirmed the news on Twitter. The Latina superstars will be part of the NFL’s bid to rebuild its embattled halftime show — one of pop music’s most visible gigs — which last year struggled to secure performers over the treatment of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick, who has not played in the NFL since opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers in March 2017, began kneeling in protest of social injustice and racial inequality during pre-game renditions of the US national anthem three years ago. The move became a talking point for Donald Trump in September 2017, with the US president saying the players were insulting the nation and should be fired. The 2019 halftime show saw the performance slot go from highly coveted to largely unwanted, with prominent artists including Rihanna, P!nk and Cardi B reportedly turning it down over Kaepernick’s plight. The radio-friendly pop band Maroon 5 controversially led the marquee show alongside rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi. In August, the NFL entered a partnership with rapper Jay-Z, which the league hailed as a move to promote social justice and the artist said would allow the league to advance from protest to action. But many criticized Jay-Z’s deal with the NFL, with some calling it a “money move” that betrayed Kaepernick, whom the entertainment mogul had thrown his weight behind in the past. Jay-Z’s music and sports company Roc Nation represents Shakira. VANGUARD Pop superstar Rihanna declined an offer to perform at a Super Bowl halftime show because she supported former National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his protest against racial injustice. October 19, 2018 In "Music" Colombian pop singer Shakira Ripoll appeared in a Spanish court on Thursday to defend herself against allegations of tax evasion amounting to 16.3 million dollars, her management firm said.
