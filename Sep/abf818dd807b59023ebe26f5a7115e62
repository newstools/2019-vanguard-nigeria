The PDP had on Wednesday vowed to appeal the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal which upheld the election of President Muhammadu Buhari.

He said: “We as a party, we are confident, if it is within the Nigerian law, for PDP to go even to the World Court, we will meet them there. The Supreme Court is Supreme Court of Nigeria not Supreme Court of APC or PDP. “We are ready to meet them, President Buhari is ready to meet defeated Atiku Abubakar at the Supreme Court and the All Progressives Congress is ready to meet PDP at that court,” he said. The APC chairman urged Atiku Abubakar and the entire members of the opposition party to forget about what happened at the polls and support Buhari to move Nigeria forward.
