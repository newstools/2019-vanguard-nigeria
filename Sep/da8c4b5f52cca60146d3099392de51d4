ABUJA- The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Sunday described as disgraceful the outing and alleged poor attention given to President Muhammadu Buhari by world leaders and investors at the 7th Tokyo International Conference on Africa Development, TICAD.<img class="size-full wp-image-1245629 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BUHARI-CHINA1.gif?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="427" data-recalc-dims="1" /> It also said the development is an indication that the nation under the stewardship of President Buhari has been rejected by the international community. The party also described as a national embarrassment and shame “that President Buhari could not seal any meaningful economic agreement at the conference but only came home with an empty basket and pocket full of promissory notes.” In a statement issued by party’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan,  The PDP said the Tokyo gathering  the has shown that “no world leader or international investors want to do any real business with Nigeria under President Buhari, mainly because of the legitimacy burden of his Presidency, arising from the rigging of the February 23 Presidential election, as well as overt impunity, corruption, treasury looting and recklessness that pervade his administration.” The statement continued: “It is lamentable that while President Buhari and his party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, are reducing our nation by celebrating a mere pledge of $300,000 (N108 million) from the Japanese Prime Minister and a promissory note for 50 million euros from an EU Commissioner, his Ghanaian counterpart, Nana Akufo-Ado had sealed a deal with automobile giant, Toyota, to immediately establish a Toyota and Suzuki manufacturing plant in Ghana with a determined timeline of August 2020 for production. “The multinational had also signed a deal to establish a similar plant in neighboring Ivory Coast with a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect already signed last Thursday. “It is instructive to note that Toyota announced that it preferred to cite the plant in Ghana because of the favourable economic climate prevailing in the country; a climate, which has taken flight from Nigeria under President Buhari and worsened since the rigging of the Presidential election.

That is the only way our nation can enjoy the benefit of an acceptable and purposeful leadership, which will return her to the path of peaceful co-existence, political stability and economic prosperity.” Vanguard The special adviser on media and publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Femi Adesina has engaged the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Pastor Reno Omokri in a fierce battle of knowledge.
