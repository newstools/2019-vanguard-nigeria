With the theme, “Tourism and Jobs: A Better Future for All”, the event according to her  highlighted the relevance the tourism sector plays in creating more and better jobs for millions of people everywhere, not only presently, but also for the future, with numerous possibilities for opportunities and challenges. “The event, featured an interactive and panel session, will coincide with the international celebration of World Tourism Day, a day set aside by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) to foster awareness among the international community of the importance of tourism and its social, cultural, political and economic value. “The theme could not have come at a better time when 1 out of 20 jobs is from the travel and tourism sector coupled with the increasing contributions of the Nigerian hospitality to the labour market. The Nigeria Hospitality report published by Jumia travel reports that the number of direct jobs created by the sector peaked at 1.2 million compared to 651,000 in 2016 (1.6%), that’s 1.8% of total employment in the country.
