Dugum, who spoke through the Deputy Zonal Head, Alex Ebbah, said upon receiving the directives of the acting Chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Magu, the zone launched an independent raid against the fraudsters. He added: “In furtherance to the acting Chairman’s directive to all the zones, we have independently launched intensive investigative actions against this infamous Yahoo Yahoo Boys, culminating in various strategic raids and onslaught on their hideouts. “ Our effort in this regards has recorded tremendous success, which resulted in over 60 arrests, 37 convictions and recovery of a number or exotic cars and property suspected to have been acquired through the proceeds of the crimes.” Dugum maintained that the commission, through the collaboration with FBI and other international law enforcement agencies, has received over 20 different cases of internet frauds reported directly by the FBI through U.S. Department of Justice, some of which are already under investigation. He mentioned that EFCC, through mutual legal assistance with other international law enforcement agencies, has received five cases from Hong-Kong Police, five from Danish and Norwegian police and four from Israeli police, three from Austrian police, one from Sweden police and one from Zambian police. Dugum said investigation of the cases had resulted in the arrest of seven of the fraudsters.
