It is also to serve as the center for the collection, protection, exhibition, and promotion of antiquities, treasures and traditional art forms of Africa; to embark on initiatives that can restore and reinforce the dignity of the African person such as the uprooted in the diaspora; and to work in all possible ways for healthy global cultural interaction which will afford African and Africans the rare privilege of showcasing their cultures and histories; to encourage more collaborations (local and international) between O?ò?ni of Ifè? and nations, institutions, organizations and individuals that may be interested in the preservation and promotion of African heritage and to promote rare positive virtues by which the Odùduwà hero/heroine is traditionally defined. In recognition of the value of good memories and personalities worthy of emulation, the museum project will equally be committed to honoring and celebrating persons who are of Odùduwà ancestry and who are known to have performed or attained great feats as a way of spurring other Odùduwà descendants to enviable heights. Interestingly, the unveiling ceremony will coincide with Brazil’s 197th Independence Anniversary and thus provide a befitting celebration of her independence of September 7, 1822 on the continent of origin of millions of Brazilians. On the affinity between Oduduwa people and Brazil, the statement said that Brazil is the only country in the world with over 80 million Odùduwà descendants as part of her population. It noted that as a country that has adopted Yorùbá as official language (lingua franca), and the first country to collaborate with the House of Odùduwà on the promotion of African Heritage, the crucial place of Brazil in the project is worthy of note. “It is therefore appropriate that the museum project has been designed to have Ilé-Ifè? and Brazil as its split base,” it said.
