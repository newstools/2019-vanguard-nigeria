Chronic pain is pain that is ongoing and usually lasts longer than three months. This type of pain can continue even after the injury or illness that caused it has healed or gone away. Pain signals remain active in the nervous system for weeks, months, or years. Some people suffer chronic pain even when there is no past injury or apparent body damage. “Chronic pain is linked to conditions including, Headache, Arthritis Cancer, Nerve pain, Back pain, Fibromyalgia pain. In management of pain, treatment should aim to decrease the intensity of acute pain in an effort to reduce or prevent permanent changes in the nervous system that may result in chronic pain. “One of the more long-standing recommendations of chronic pain rehabilitation is to reduce pain behaviors.” In his speech, the Chairman of Ebonyi State chapter of Nigeria Society of Physiotherapy, Anekwu Emelie Moris stated that “This day was set aside by the World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT) the world body that sees to the unity and promotion of physical therapy in the world to which Nigeria Society of Physiotherapy is a member organization.” “Yesterday, we were at the Democracy Estate Primary School, Aguogboriga, Abakaliki to commission a volleyball court which we built as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility.
