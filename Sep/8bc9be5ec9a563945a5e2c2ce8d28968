The General Secretary, National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), Chief Ayo Opadokun, has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory at the Presidential Election Tribunal on Wednesday as a victory for democracy. Opadokun spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Wednesday. NAN reports that the tribunal had dismissed the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, challenging the victory of Buhari in the Feb. 23 poll. Opadokun said that the judiciary had discharged its responsibility as an arbiter between the two political parties. He said: “I believe that this is a victory for democracy because the judiciary had discharged the onus of its responsibility as an arbiter between two political parties.

He also said the allegations that figures were falsified were not enough as the petitioner had to prove these beyond reasonable doubt. Opadokun, however, said the petitioner could still approach the Supreme Court for a resolution of the matter if unsatisfied with the tribunal’s judgment. He said with the judgement, however, the judges had made a landmark pronouncement that would guide political parties and their candidates when approaching elections subsequently and preparing their petitions. “As a lawyer, I am proudly behind the reasoning for the judgment on the presidential election that was given today (Wednesday) in an eight-hour plus sitting. “The judges exhibited intellectual capacity to examine every milestone that was in fulcrum of the petition. “They responded to every issue that was canvassed by the petitioner. They also provided a legal rationale for their conclusion and the judgement they arrived at.

Opadokun said the judges had presented the judiciary in a very positive light because they did not leave out any matter of importance.
