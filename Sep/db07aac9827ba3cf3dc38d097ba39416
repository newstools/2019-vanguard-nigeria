Tottenham midfielder Giovani Lo Celso will be sidelined until late October after injuring a hip on international duty with Argentina. He suffered the damage during Argentina’s 0-0 friendly draw against Chile in Los Angeles last week. The 23-year-old was forced to withdraw from the Argentina squad and is back at his Premier League club for treatment. “Giovani Lo Celso has returned early to Hotspur Way after being withdrawn from the Argentina squad due to a hip injury,” said a statement on Tottenham’s website.

The highly-rated Argentine has made three substitute appearances since arriving from Real Betis on a season-long loan on transfer deadline day, with a view to a permanent move.
