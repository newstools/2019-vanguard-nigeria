According to him, the need to communicate clearly and precisely within the over 16,000-staff strength of the Commission itself, and with its huge and varied outside stakeholders in carrying out its mandate was of such great importance that INEC included it among its five strategic objectives, the first time it took the decision to have a Communication Policy five years ago. “Since then, much has changed in the politics and socio-economics of the country. Accordingly, the Commission took a decision to revise its Communication Policy to take into account these changes. To this end, the revised policy contained in this document has incorporated new techniques, multiple platforms and monitoring templates for the attainment of the objectives contained in the Commission’s Strategic Plan”, he explained. The new policy which conceded that the FOI Act applies to INEC, added that the Commission is under a legal obligation to comply with the law and fully implement it. “INEC fully intends to comply with the provisions of the FOI Act, as this will further enhance its transparency and accountability, while also reinforcing its public image of integrity and credibility as well as strengthening public trust and confidence in the Commission. The framework for the disclosure of information to members of the public under the FOI Act will therefore form an integral part of the Communication Policy of the Commission”, the electoral umpire declared in the document. INEC noted that the revised communication policy/strategy “is informed by the need for the Commission to earn and sustain public trust; remain visible, accessible and accountable to the public; comply with legislations requiring transparency and proactive disclosure of information; have an integrated approach to information dissemination that is both traditional and IT-driven; and for staff to use information technology and communication facilities responsibly and professionally”. Ultimately, the communication policy will enhance INEC’s transparency, credibility and integrity as well as strengthen and sustain public trust and confidence in the Commission.
