CRS won the First Edition of the National U-17 Youth Games in 2013. CRS won the National School Sports Festival for 4 consecutive years before Gov. Imoke’s Comprehensive Sports Development Program (CSDP) was discontinued in September 2015 by the current administration.<img class="size-full wp-image-1261681 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=640%2C1235&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="1235" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=155%2C300&amp;ssl=1 155w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=768%2C1482&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=531%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=30%2C58&amp;ssl=1 30w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=101%2C194&amp;ssl=1 101w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=67%2C130&amp;ssl=1 67w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?resize=560%2C1080&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/graph.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> CRS had the best  grassroots sports development program in Nigeria in 2015 before the program was killed. CRS had the best U-17 team in Athletics, Boxing, weightlifting, swimming etc. before the program was killed in 2015. In fact, the CRS U-17 team of 2015 would have topped the medals table at the 2019 Youth Games. 2.5m children suffering acute malnutrition in Nigeria – UNICEF(Opens in a new browser tab) Killing that program and destroying the lives and future of hundreds of thousands  of CRS youths is the costliest and most backward decision taken by the current CRS government. I still believe that  Prof. Ayade has not been properly and truthfully briefed about the huge investment made and success achieved by Imoke’s regime in this sector. From 2011 to 2015 CRS topped the nation and laid a solid foundation for continuity, but today we are nowhere to reckon with.

It does not have to cost a fortune, but the funds allocated must be used to implement the project. Over 200 million naira worth of world class equipment are already in storage at the UJ Esuene stadium to accomplish this. The youths are yearning for the opportunity to serve their state and secure a great future for themselves. Prof. Ayade can reverse the trend in the next four years and take credit for the rebirth. CRS can climb back to the top, where they belong, before the tenure of the current government expires. It is not too late. Cross Riverians deserve this gift. Vanguard Sir, some years ago, 2009 to be precise, Cross River State started a programme meant to develop sports at the grassroots.
