I am determined to secure Nigeria – Buhari(Opens in a new browser tab) “He has severally described the President with the most distasteful terms and has shown, especially on social media, that he sees nothing good in the administration of President Buhari. “Onigbinde had also gone to the shameful extent of describing those who support the President and his administration as ethnic jingoists. He once referred to the President as incompetent, and accused him of being a dictator committing illegality. “Onigbinde lacks honour. He been browbeating all the while so he could achieve some notice and be sneaked in at night into the same government he publicly threw invectives at. “If Seun was called by anyone to take an appointment in a government he ridiculed and called illegal and dictatorial, he should have turned it down, if he had any decency or morals. “Does he now want to serve in this same government and become part of what he had called illegality and dictatorship? “There are countless supporters of the President who are better qualified”.
