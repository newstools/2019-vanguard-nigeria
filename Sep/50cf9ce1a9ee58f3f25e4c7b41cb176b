The statement said that the arrest was as a result of a petition jointly signed and presented to the commission by 39 workers of the Agency, alleging that their three months salaries are being withheld without any reason. “They further alleged that the suspects refused to pay their salaries and diverted the money for their personal use, and all efforts made to get their salaries paid, proved abortive. “However, a preliminary investigation revealed that, the two conspired and diverted about N10 million funds meant for the Marshalls’ salaries,” it said. It added that the suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigations were concluded.
