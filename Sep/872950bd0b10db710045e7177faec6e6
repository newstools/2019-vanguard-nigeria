So work will soon begin on Third Mainland Bridge.’’ Kuti said that the Muhammadu  Buhari administration was committed to fixing bridges in Lagos. He said that this was evident in the number of bridges that had been repaired in the state, with many more receiving attention. “This government has very good plans for bridges. Since I came on board, about a year ago, we have completed maintenance and repair works on Leventis Bridge, damaged by fire in 2016 where a whole deck collapsed. “We have also completely repaired the  Ijora-7Up Bridge. Coconut Bridge repair has been completed; the burnt Marine Beach Bridge repair has been completed and as I speak, maintenance work is ongoing on the Independence Bridge on the Island. “Work is ongoing on the Dorman Long Bridge, you can drive smoothly on it now and all the guard rails and expansion joints are being replaced. “Work is ongoing on the Ojuelegba Bridge as well as Alaka Bridge,’’ he stated. According to him, although procurement issues affected project delivery, there are enough materials from Alaka Bridge expansion joint works to repair adjoining bridges on the Apapa-Ijora axis. The controller said he had given instruction to a contractor to move to site to rehabilitate a portion of the  Apapa Bridge. “ I have a project on the Alaka Bridge. Work is going on there. “Alaka Bridge goes into Iganmu, the contractor has done a lot of work there. They have done the resurfacing, they have milled the old ashphalt and are replacing the expansion joints. “There is another expansion joint beside it. If you are coming in from Surulere and going to Alaka, the intersection is between Iganmu and Eko Bridge,  I gave instruction to fix it. “Also, at the intersection outwards Apapa and inwards Apapa from Costain area, there is a very bad expansion joint, I just gave instruction to fix it,’’ Kuti said. He added that expansion joints on the popular Long Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway would also be replaced soon. The controller, however, condemned illegal trading and other activities under bridges in Lagos, noting that some of such activities had caused fire and damaged bridges in the past. Kuti similarly, condemned indiscriminate parking on bridges, saying that bridges were designed for the movement of vehicles and not as parks.
