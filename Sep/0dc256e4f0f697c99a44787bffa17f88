Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel firm, collapsed on Monday, stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.<img class="size-full wp-image-1259429 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?resize=58%2C33&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook.jpg?resize=560%2C315&amp;ssl=1 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said it was a matter of profound regret that the company had gone out of business after it failed to secure a rescue package from its lenders. The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Thomas Cook had now ceased trading and the regulator and government would work together to bring the more than 150,000 British customers home over the next two weeks.

The demise of Thomas Cook marks the end of one of Britain’s oldest companies that started life in 1841 running local rail excursions before it survived two world wars to pioneer package holidays first in Europe and then further afield. The firm now runs hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year in 16 countries. It currently has 600,000 people abroad, forcing governments and insurance companies to coordinate a huge rescue operation. Pictures posted on social media showed Thomas Cook planes being diverted away from the normal stands, and being deserted as soon as they had landed.

Last year’s European heatwave also hit the company hard as customers put off last minute bookings.
