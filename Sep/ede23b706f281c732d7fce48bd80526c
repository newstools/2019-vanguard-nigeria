Justice Taiwo noted that an application the DSS re-approached filed to renew the detention order was struck out after it was withdrawn. He held that the application having been struck out, there was nothing before the court to warrant Sowore’s continued stay in detention. The court stressed that it was constitutionally empowered to safeguard the right to liberty of every Nigerian citizen, irrespective of position or social status. However, Justice Taiwo ordered Sowore to surrender his international passport to the Chief Registrar of the court.
