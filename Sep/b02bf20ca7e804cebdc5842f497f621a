At least 29 people were killed in two separate incidents in Burkina Faso’s troubled north on Sunday after a food convoy and a transport truck were attacked, the government said. One vehicle transporting people and goods “rode over an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Barsalogho area” leaving at least 15 passengers dead, government spokesman Remis Fulgance Dandjinou said in a statement. Most of the dead were traders. Meanwhile, about 50km away, 14 people were killed after a convoy of mostly three-wheelers taking food to people displaced by fighting, was attacked. “This drama comes as important security efforts are under way in this region,” officials said. “Military reinforcements have been deployed.” ALSO READ: Relatives fly to Singapore to bring Mugabe home The West African country’s army has been increasingly targeted by rebels.
