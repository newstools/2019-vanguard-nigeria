Commenting, Takanori Sazaki, Regional Executive for MUFG in EMEA, said: “As we at MUFG seek to strengthen our presence across Africa through innovative opportunities, this MOU with Afreximbank is perfectly timed. The continent is undergoing remarkable growth and shows no sign of relenting due to market expansion and growth in investment from overseas.

Today MUFG has offices in Cairo, Egypt, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Also speaking, Prof. Benedict Oramah, President of Afreximbank, said: “Afreximbank is proud to be signing this MOU with MUFG. It strengthens our already good relations built over the past several years. The MOU sets a solid foundation for reinforcing the economic bond between Africa and Japan at a time of increasing global trade tensions. It creates a unique opportunity for African businesses to benefit from MUFG’s increasing African presence while also enabling MUFG to enhance its offerings to Japanese entities seeking business opportunities across Africa.” Vanguard The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Russian Railways and  the Russian Export Center  (REC), agreeing to cooperate in implementing export and investment projects in the railway sector in Africa.
