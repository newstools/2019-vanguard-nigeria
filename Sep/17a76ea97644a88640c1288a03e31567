“Am here because we believed that the best way to manage our airports is to concession them to private hands to make them better managed and better operated and to get value for our money. “The Delta State Government took up the challenge and they attended to so many conferences with us, they dialogued with us at the ministry and they decided on their own to concession the Asaba Airport and here we are after three tedious years, and being fully guided by the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission ICRC to put this to reality. “The Asaba Airport is on its way to being fully concessioned, they have feeder airlines that will operate as well as a principal airline coming in to Asaba and feeding other stations, they have a hotel, Business park, cargo and they have everything here an international airport needs to operate and all of these are from the private sector and if it works, this is a classical example of partnership with the private sector to develop our infrastructure for the common good of our people”.
“This is a modest example of how things should be, we will carry out more of these inspections, as a ministry we are responsible for civil aviation and air transportation in general and we will not be found wanting in this regard. Coming here excites me, it shows me the courage and determination by the State Government to partner with the private sector to develop this airport. “From what I have seen here and from what we have on ground and also the planned expansion of the terminal building, the Asaba Airport is indeed an international airport in that regard,” he said. The Minister who was conducted round by the Delta State Commissioner for Information Mr. Charles Aniagwu and Senior Policy Adviser to the Governor Prof. Sylvester Monye was accompanied by the Acting Permanent Secretary Ministry of Aviation Engr.
