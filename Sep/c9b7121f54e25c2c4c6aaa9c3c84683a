A candidate will spent six years in primary school, secondary school six years making 12 years. “If you are fortunate one way or the other and save one, two, three years of excessive speed, “So, for me, if we have 15 years as they have agreed, nobody who is below 15 years should register; and anybody who is below 15 years let’s come and address that person specifically,’’ he said. Earlier, the Director General of NIMC, Mr  Aliyu Aziz Abubakar,  said  the commission got the approval of the Federal Executive Council mandating all private and government agencies to ensure that their data met NIMC standard. Abubakar said the idea was to enable NIMC duplicate those data for national security and development. “We have already got the approval of Federal Executive Council to ensure that private and government agencies that are already capturing data should capture to the standard set by NIMC so that we can duplicate those data. “So, with the private and other government agencies into the picture, so we ensure that we have more than 10,000 centres so that every ward in Nigeria will have an enrolment centre,” he said.
