Llorente made 24 international appearances between 2008-2013, winning the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012.

Llorente’s time at Tottenham did not go to plan, as he served as back-up to Harry Kane and managed only two goals in 36 Premier League games. He did, however, score 11 times in cup competitions, including crucial Champions League strikes against Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund last season as Spurs reached the final.
