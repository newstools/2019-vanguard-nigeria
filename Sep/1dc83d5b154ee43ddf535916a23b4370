Since I had just moved into Lekki with my husband then, I decided to make this my family hospital. It has been a great experience, trust me. I am so happy and that is why I decided to have my baby in Nigeria because I trust the people here. I actually traveled out but I came back to Nigeria because I wanted him here at Vedic hospital, with trusted hands.” Lizzy Anjorin however insisted that Toyin Abraham gave birth to her child in a traditional centre in Nigeria. “Toyin is a liar. Even a fool knows that the video circulating was recently cooked up. You’ve seen fools, right? You are a liar. You put to birth in a traditional birth centre. I’ve said it and I’m repeating it,” she said.
