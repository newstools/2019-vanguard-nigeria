Some of them we bought, some we leased, some are on revenue-sharing arrangement.” “This is the first time we are making our own film. We took our time to make sure the film we will make as our flagship film will be one that will travel globally and bring smiles on the faces of Africans and lovers of African content everywhere,” he disclosed. Aluko’s Residence, an approximately 30-minute-weekly comedy series designed for the entertainment of the general web audience, will run every Friday on Ogelle.com beginning mid-October, Oparaugo added. IPOB to S/east govns: We don’t need your apology; you’ll know how upset we’re if we meet abroad(Opens in a new browser tab) Áluko Residence’ is the story of a newly married young couple with rather faulty marital foundation. Ola Aluko falls on hard times but is convinced by a pastor that getting married is the solution out of his stagnant career. His fiancée Ovie, a successful wedding planner, bails him out as she sponsors their wedding with the promise that he will repay as soon as fortune smiles on him. The couple agree to keep this a secret and both families are not aware of this arrangement. The upheavals arising from this arrangement, the interference of family members who feel entitled, and the antics of the security man at the gate, ‘Bill Gates’ played by ‘Monkals Kalu’, makes the hilarious drama a film to watch. “The drama is the dynamics of the family. People will enjoy watching how everyday life is handled in the household. It also addresses different issues in the society, strategically focusing on things people are dealing with, and addressing certain social issues wrapped up in a comedic story,” said Jimi Odukoya, who plays the character of Ola Aluko.. On what makes the film unique and truly African, Oparaugo said it will be dubbed (lip-synched) in seven African languages, including Swahili and French. “You will watch ‘Aluko’s Residence’ in your preferred language. It is going to come out in those languages such that when you go on Ogelle, you will select a preferred language to watch. It is lip-synched in those languages, so you will hear the voice of the same actor talking in your native language,” he said. “We want to create an African drama and we are happy with the project. We are happy with the people we have got on board, fantastic individuals, from the writers to the directors, assistant producer, the actors themselves, the make-up artistes, etc – very fantastic people who are committed to getting the best out of this movie,” he further said.

Try to be the mediator and promoter of peace in the home as much as possible as well as going out to fend for the home,” she added.
