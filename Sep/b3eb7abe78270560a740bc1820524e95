A breakdown of the debt figures shows that Lagos came first with N542.2 billion, followed by Osun with debt stock of N147.7 billion. Ekiti has a debt burden of N118.01 billion, Ogun N97.09 billion, Oyo N94.14 billion and Ondo N56.96 billion. Tella said that these states needed to explain to their citizens what the loans were used for. “There is the need for the states concerned to explain to their citizens what they used the loans for. “They collected Paris loan largess like other states to pay outstanding salary arrears and were reimbursed by the Federal Government for the federal roads executed.

So, where did the foreign loans go into?,” Tella asked. He said that the Houses of Assembly in the concerned states and the civil society organisations must inquire into the issue. According to him, the public too must be interested on how loans contracted on their behalf are utilised. “This is because their children will not enjoy development, but will pay for funds that were mismanaged,” Tella said.
