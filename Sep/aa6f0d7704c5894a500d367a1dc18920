Rev Istifanus Koce of ECWA Good News Church, Kuje, FCT, on Sunday said that Nigeria’s problems were unrelenting because Nigerians were not prayerful. “Nigeria’s problems keep getting worse because we do not pray fervently. We must pray for our country and its leaders,” Koce said at the inauguration of new executive officers to pilot the affairs of the Church in the next six years. “Christians must pray more. We should not be tired of begging God to intervene in our situation. God knows what we are going through, but we must pray for grace and mercy,” he said. Koce charged Christians to be dedicated to their duties towards the growth and development of the Church, urging them to shun evil and embrace righteousness. According to NAN report, the cleric said that Nigerians could only attract God’s blessings if they kept their hearts pure and free of wickedness.
