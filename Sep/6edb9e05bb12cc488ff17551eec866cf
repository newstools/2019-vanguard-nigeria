Billed to run up until end of September, this edition  is devoted to supporting interest in nuclear research and capabilities among young Nigerian and  African scientists.  Participants are required to research how innovative use of nuclear technologies can assist in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, UNSDGs, in Africa. To compete, they have to make a short video about their findings on the topic and share on Facebook. A two stage judging process will be used to select the winning teams, an independent jury made up of nuclear professionals and experts on sustainability topics will select the top 10 videos and the general public will be invited to vote for the best video on the Rosatom Africa Facebook page. The award ceremony will take place within two African Nuclear Youth Summits to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa in early October 2019.

The trip to Russia for winning teams will include visits to well-known Moscow landmarks, Russia’s state-of-the-art nuclear facilities, top nuclear universities as well as other scientific and technological facilities. The winners will also meet African students currently studying various nuclear disciplines in Russia. Recall, last year, a Nigerian, Ugenyi Igbokwe, was among the finalists – beating other participants from across Africa.Underscoring ROSATOM’s commitment towards nurturing young professionals in the field of Nuclear energy, CEO, ROSATOM Central and Southern Africa, Dmitry Shornikov, said: “One of our key missions at ROSATOM is to assist the brightest young minds from across the globe to work together in solving global challenges that will shape the future of energy and the world as we know it.” He added: “This is a great opportunity for young people from very different walks of life who share a common passion to build a bright and sustainable future for Africa to discover more about various nuclear applications and their vast benefits for the region”. The federal government of Nigeria had signed an agreement with Russia’s ROSATOM for the construction of  nuclear power plants and a nuclear research center in Nigeria. Vanguard Nigeria is today, regarded as the biggest economy in Africa. However, its power sector is performing far below the level of an economy of this magnitude. Over half of the population has no access to grid-connected electricity and those who are connected to the grid suffer extensive power outages. April 25, 2018 In "News" Inspired by the need to address Nigeria's perennial electricity shortfalls, Russia's state-owned nuclear energy corporation, ROSATOM, is proposing off-grid technologies – such as mini hydro power stations as an effective solution to ensure access to electricity for Nigeria’s increasing population.The corporation said its prescriptions are underscored by the fact that… June 27, 2018 In "Technology" Russia's ,State Atomic Energy Corporation, Rosatom, has, said that Nigeria should add nuclear energy to its energy mix to harness abundant benefits and most importantly improve its current power situation.
