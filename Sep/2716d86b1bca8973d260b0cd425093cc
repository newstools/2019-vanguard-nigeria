While affirming that the Supreme Court which he heads is independent in the ways judges conduct their affairs, especially in their judgements, he admitted that their annual budgets are far below their needs and he often has to “beg” for their funds to be released. The question is, how can you be “free” when you are starved of funds and even at that, you have to beg another arm of government before your money is released? We do not agree with the CJN that the Supreme Court or any other level of the Judiciary is free enough. Whoever pays the piper calls the tune. So long as the Judiciary is made to suffer the impunity of fund starvation by the Executive inherited from the military, the Judiciary can never be free. Secondly, for as long as the President of Nigeria is allowed the audacity he displayed in the removal of former CJN Walter Onnoghen and the appointment of Justice Mohammed, the Judiciary is still a lapdog of the Executive. 1. Atiku, PDP list 66 reasons why Supreme Court should sack Buhari, order fresh election

Disclosing this in a statement,  the Director of Information at the Office of Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Willie Bassey, said Keyamo would replace Tayo Alasoadura as the Minister of State at the labour ministry, while Alasoadura replaced him at the Niger Delta Affairs ministry. 4. Osinbajo’s ordeal with the Presidency, not our Concern – Senate The Senate, Tuesday distanced itself from the seeming political imbroglio between the Presidency and the Vice President, Professor  Yemi Osinbajo, saying that the issue was not its concern.
