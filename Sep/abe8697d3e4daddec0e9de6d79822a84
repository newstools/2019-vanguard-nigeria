Simply share your referral code with as many people as possible and with each person that takes a loan using your code and pays back, you get N1500 every time.

Click on “earn 1500” to view your unique referral code
Click on “invite friends” to share with friends (or anyone sef)
Select any of the apps on your phone that you want to share the code from
Select the contacts you want to share with and share with them
Ask your friend to enter your unique code before they repay (this is very important o!)
Once they repay their loan as scheduled, you will receive N1500 in your bonus account which will be applied to your next loan. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1259361" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Branch-Win-Win.gif?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="640" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Super simple isn’t it? It’s just as simple for your friends or anyone you refer too – plus they get N500 once they repay their loans too! They don’t have to do too much either. Here’s what they need to do: They’ll click on the link in the invite message that you share with them
They’ll download the app, register and apply for a loan
If their loan is approved, they will receive the loan amount in their account in minutes
Now, they just have to go to the menu and click “promotions”
They’ll enter the unique code that came in the invite message you sent to them before their repayment date
Once they repay, they will receive N500 in their bonus account which will be applied to their next loan. This is a huge opportunity, isn’t it?
