Earlier, the Federal Government of Nigeria had debunked reports being circulated on social media of a bomb explosion at the South African High Commission. In a statement, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the report “is fake news orchestrated by desperate opposition to cause panic and chaos among the populace”. Mohammed observed the video of the purported bomb explosion was that of a bomb explosion at Emab Plaza, near Banex, Abuja, which occurred on June 25, 2014. “A pattern is emerging of the antics of the desperate opposition to latch on to the use of fake news and disinformation as a strategy to trigger chaos in the country,” he said.
