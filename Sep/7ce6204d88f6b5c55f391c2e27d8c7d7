Championship strugglers Huddersfield hired Lincoln’s Danny Cowley as their new manager on Monday. Cowley will be joined at Huddersfield by his brother Nicky, who worked with him as Lincoln’s assistant manager. Huddersfield have been looking for a new boss since the dismissal of Jan Siewert, who was sacked on August 16 after the Terriers made a poor start to the season and were knocked out of the League Cup by Cowley’s third-tier Lincoln. Huddersfield are second bottom of the Championship with one point, having lost five of their six league games since last season’s relegation from the Premier League.
