It is not just the public that is impressed; the Eclipse Cross crossover SUV was selected as the “RJC Car of the Year 2019” run by the Automotive Researchers and Journalists Conference of Japan (RJC). In 2018, the car earned the highest safety rating according to the independent European organization Euro NCAP and was also awarded by the Nigeria Automotive Journalists Association (NAJA) as the Outstanding SUV design of the year. Massilia Motors General Manager (Sales), Mr Tunji Itiola explained: “The SUV is equipped for the Nigerian market with a 2.0 litre Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) petrol engine that allows seamless gear interchange, giving the smoothest driving experience within its category. Not only is the Eclipse Cross a stylish fusion of a sharp coupe and a compact SUV, but it also has high rough road performance and well-balanced dynamics, due to Mitsubishi’s unique Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) four-wheel-drive system.” The Eclipse Cross is an upscale model with super exciting features which include, the Adaptive Cruise Control, which maintains a selected distance between your vehicle and the car ahead using radar. It reduces driving stress, especially during traffic jams on highways and assures better safety. Another award-winning safety feature of the Eclipse Cross is the Lane Departure Warning Intelligent sensors placed all around the vehicle monitors your surroundings and provide active warnings to alert you of possible danger. For instance, if your car is drifting from its lane while the turn signals are not operating. To top it all, the most unique innovation of this beauty is the Head-Up Display (HUD), which conveys information above the dashboard for easy viewing.
