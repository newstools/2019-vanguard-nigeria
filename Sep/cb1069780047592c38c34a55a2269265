Nwoji explains his motivation in writing the book: “Having attended a wide spread of educational institutions and conferences globally and having managed a corporate institution in Nigeria with a staff component with diversities in cultures, religion, mode of dressing, and even mode of eating, my motivation in writing this book is a modest attempt to contribute to the world of learning particularly in a changing world where understanding the peculiarities of human and business management is absolutely imperative.” The author also speaks on the choice of the title, “Universality of multiculturalism is a natural phenomenon for cohesive human existence; no two human beings are born the same, even Siamese twins have their differences, the Chinese with seemingly common physical physiognomy have different reactive dispositions. Diversities in human behaviour, cultural differences, religious differences and language differences are nature’s supreme imposition on mankind.” Mourinho: Why I dumped Salah at Chelsea(Opens in a new browser tab) Understanding the dynamics of multiculturalism as has been established in this book is the panacea to managing cross border businesses where diversities in culture, religion, ethnicity, colour and language constitute constraints.

It is this absolute truth that makes a case for a closer understanding of the various diversities existing among the diverse nations of the world”.
