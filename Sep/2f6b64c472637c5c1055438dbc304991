Much damage had, however, been done before the fire was put out by a combined team of the Anambra State Fire Service and other residents of the area. Narrating the incident to sympathisers, Igwedimma said she returned to the house to perform some chores, when she saw the roof of the building in flames, adding that her first reaction was to rescue the three children, who were sleeping in the burning house. “Thereafter, I quickly raised the alarm for help, as I was overwhelmed while trying to salvage few items from the inferno,” she said. Owner of the building, Mrs. Blessing Uchendu, a staff of the state-owned Anambra Broadcas-ting Service, ABS, said she was at work when a call came that her house was on fire, adding that she quickly rushed home to discover that everything, including her certificates, from primary school to university levels, had been destroyed in the inferno.
