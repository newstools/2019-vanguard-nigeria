The statement titled, “Re: Buhari directs Osinbajo to seek approvals for agencies under him” said Osinbajo complied with established rules where presidential approvals were required It read thus, “Our attention has been drawn to a sensational report by The Cable published on September 17, 2019, which claims that His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, has directed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, to seek approvals for agencies under him. Mugabe stood out for his commitment to Zimbabweans’ emancipation – Osinbajo(Opens in a new browser tab) ” The report suggests, falsely, that agencies under the supervision of the Vice President do not normally comply with established rules where presidential approvals are required. ” This is obviously misleading and aims only to plant seeds of discord in the Presidency, while attempting to create unnecessary national hysteria. ” The agencies in question are established by law and the Vice President has always insisted on due compliance with the enabling statutes and other established regulations. ” Depending on the particular scope of activity in question, agencies may require management approval only, at the level of the Director-General or Chief Executive Officer. In this category falls the great majority of their day-to-day activities. ” However, other activities, or procurements, with value exceeding a certain threshold, require Board approval. These may get to the agency Board chaired by the Vice President. In a few cases where Presidential approval is required, the Director-General must seek such approval from the President, through the Vice President. These rules have always guided the activities of statutory agencies and the ones under the Vice President’s supervision have always been so guided. “To claim that in the first term of the Buhari administration, agencies of government have not been complying with the provisions (of getting final approvals from the President) is false, and the attempt to suggest the Vice President’s complicity in such irregularities is simply mischievous and reprehensible. “The effective and mutually respecting relationship between the President and the Vice President is well known to Nigerians and it is futile to insinuate otherwise. ” Even though the Vice President has a statutory role as Board Chairman of some government agencies under his office, with appropriate approval limits, which often do not include contract approvals; it is ludicrous to even insinuate that a Board Chairman approves contracts.

We urge media organizations, as gatekeepers, to uphold truth, balance, fairness and objectivity in their reports.” Vanguard Mr. Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, has said that the Vice president Yemi Osinbajo remains committed to the service of his fatherland and will continue to do so despite the purveyors of fake news.
