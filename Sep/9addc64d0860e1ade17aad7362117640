Mudiaga-Odje who addressed the press conference moments before the protest, said: “The issues at stake in this context are truly located within the present intention of Sterling Energy Exploration and Production Company Nigeria Limited to commence work with a view of operating OML 13 owned by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company, NPDC. “President Muhammadu Buhari has graciously approved the commencement of operation of OML 13 with a view of raising the national crude oil output to Three Million Barrels per day by April 2020. “The above was a sequel to the payment of the sum of $3.15 billion US Dollars by Sterling Energy Exploration and Production Company Nigeria Limited to the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company for the operation of the OML 13. “Needless to accentuate that, the Iko Community hosts the largest Oil Fields, ie Utapate Oil Fields and a Flow-station in the OML 13 Cluster arrangements as established by NPDC. “Our clients had expected that the State Government, Eastern Obolo Local Government Council, SEEPCO and Naturals Oil Services Limited, NOSL will directly interface with the Iko Community on these issues and more, as duly represented by Our clients. “However, to our clients’ chagrin and utter dismay, SEEPCO decided, on the contrary, to set up a Committee for that purpose, and which said Committee does not represent in its true sense the interests of our clients, Iko Community. “Our clients have therefore resolved unequivocally and unanimously to henceforth deal directly with NPDC on this matter of the operations of OML 13 as they have completely lost faith in the sincerity of SEEPCO and NOSL on this Issue”.
