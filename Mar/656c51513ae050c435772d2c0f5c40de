Alhaji Hashim Suleiman, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on Urban Beautification has resigned his appointment on the basis of the governor’s refusal to accept defeat in the governorship election.  Suleiman in his resignation letter thanked the governor for offering him the opportunity to serve while attributing his reason as the failure of Ganduje to concede defeat to the governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Abba Kabir Yusuf. He further stated that Abba won the election but it was declared inconclusive in controversial circumstances by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. According to him, Ganduje, as a transparent Khadimul-Islam (The Custodian of Islam) ought to have conceded defeat, so as to serve as a precedent to other Muslims, who serve Allah in truth and sincerity. In his letter of resignation, dated, Wednesday, March 13,2019, which he personally signed, he said: ”I write to formally inform you of my voluntary resignation from the office of SSA, Beautification. I thank you for offering me the opportunity to serve under your administration as SSA.” I will leave a legacy of stronger Delta – Okowa
